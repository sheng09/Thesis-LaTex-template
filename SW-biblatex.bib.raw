	abstract = {We apply a waveform inversion method based on simulated annealing to complex core phase data observed by globally deployed seismic arrays, and present regional variation of depth profiles of attenuation and velocity for the top half of the inner core. Whereas measured attenuation parameters exhibit consistent trends for data sampling the eastern hemisphere of the inner core, for the western hemisphere, there is a remarkable difference between data sampling the inner core beneath Africa (W1) and beneath north America (W2). Obtained attenuation profiles suggest that intricate heterogeneities appear to be confined in the top 300km. The profile for the eastern hemisphere has a high attenuation zone in the top 150km that gradually diminishes with depth. Conversely, for the western hemisphere, the profile for W1 shows constant low attenuation and that for W2 represents a gradual increase from the inner core boundary to a peak at around 200km depth. Velocity profiles, obtained from differential traveltimes between {PKP}({DF}) and {PKP}({CD}, {BC}) phases, for the eastern and western hemispheres are respectively about 0.8\% faster and 0.6\% slower than the reference model at the top of the inner core, and the difference nearly disappears at about 200km depth. Our result suggests the presence of intricate quasi-hemispherical structures in the top ∼200–300km of the inner core.},

	abstract = {Studies of velocity structure in the Earth's inner core and its volumetric variations illuminate our understanding of inner core dynamics and composition. Here we use an extensive number of seismograms recorded by the Hi-net array to construct complete empirical curves of {PKPBC}-{PKPDF} differential traveltimes. The nature of these curves implies that significant variations in traveltimes are accumulated during the passage of {PKPDF} waves through the uppermost inner core and rules out outer core structure effects. Uniform cylindrical anisotropy of a plausible strength in the uppermost inner core can also be ruled out as a cause of the observed traveltime variations because the range of sampled ray angles is too narrow. The configuration and strength of inhomogeneities from a recent tomographic model of the lowermost mantle cannot account for the observed traveltime variations. Therefore, we infer that either variations of P wave isotropic velocity on the scale of about hundred km and less are present in the uppermost inner core or the material may be organized in distinctive anisotropic domains, and both of these features may be superimposed on long-wavelength hemispherical structure. If the former holds true, the absolute magnitude of required P wave velocity perturbations from referent values is 0.60 ± 0.10\% in the quasi-eastern and 1.55 ± 0.15\% in the quasi-western hemisphere (0.85 ± 0.05\% and 1.10 ± 0.10\%, respectively, with the lowermost mantle correction). The existence of these variations is a plausible physical outcome given that vigorous compositional convection in the outer core and variations in heat exchange across the inner core boundary may control the process of solidification.},

For this, we model and interpret ambient noise correlations as recordings of correlation wavefields, which completely eliminates the limiting assumptions of Green's function retrieval, such as equipartitioning and homogeneous random noise sources. Our method accounts for seismic wave propagation physics in 3-D heterogeneous and attenuating media and also for the heterogeneous and nonstationary nature of the ambient noise field. Designed as a proof of concept, the study considers long periods from 100 to 300 s, thus focusing on the Earth's hum. Treating correlations as self-consistent observables allows us to make separate measurements on the causal and acausal branches of correlation functions, without any need to choose one of them or form the average. We validate our approach by assessing the quality of the obtained models and by comparing them to previous studies. This work is a step toward the establishment of full-waveform ambient noise inversion as a tomographic technique with the goal to go beyond ambient noise tomography based on Green's function retrieval.},

	abstract = {Seismology has come a long way in providing insights into Earth's internal structure and dynamics. Among many forward and inverse geophysical techniques developed, full waveform modelling, seismic tomography and receiver-based studies enabled detailed imaging of Earth's subsurface. The invention of ambient noise tomography within the last two decades revolutionized studies of Earth's subsurface based on the cross-correlation of the Earth's ambient noise. That method, in particular, enabled imaging of Earth structure in places where earthquakes or receivers do not exist. At the same time, progress in imaging the Earth's deepest shells has been impeded by the lack of geometric coverage of body waves due to uneven global distribution of seismic sources and receivers and the fact that the ambient noise studies cannot reach deeper than the uppermost Earth's shells, near its surface. In seeking the ways forward, global seismologists started experimenting with cross-correlating the part of the seismograms recorded many hours after the first arrivals of body-waves, the so-called earthquake coda. As in many science disciplines, initial work on this topic resulted in controversies but also led to new realisations and discoveries that all contributed to the rise of a new paradigm – the earthquake coda-correlation wavefield, which is the focus of this review paper. We do not attempt here to provide a review of ambient-noise correlation, although we use some familiar concepts to introduce coda-correlation. Our main goal is to review theoretical and observational work to date that resulted in a better understanding of the coda-correlation wavefield, both as a phenomenon and a powerful method. The features in global correlograms exist due to many cross-terms of reverberating body-waves, a principle fundamentally different from the reconstruction of surface waves in the ambient-noise correlograms. Once the coda-correlation wavefield is fully understood through theoretical developments, the method becomes a powerful way to study Earth's deep structure. Apart from providing a review of the most important results to date, we scrutinise the process of making global correlograms and analyse their characteristics while taking into consideration various aspects, such as the time after the earthquake, the source-receiver geometries, the level of seismicity and the type of earthquake mechanism. Furthermore, we provide practical examples on how to build correlograms and interpret correlogram features using programming language Python. Our review seeks to promote the topic of coda correlation among already experienced researchers as well as students who embark on this interesting research, which may play a central role in global and planetary seismology in the coming decades.},

Although the observed body wave propagation is similar to that of the corresponding components of Green's functions, there are two differences between them: the lack of reflection phases in the observation and the dominance of shear-coupled {PL} waves in the observation. These differences originate from the dominance of shear-traction sources on the Earth's surface, which causes the breakdown of equipartition among modes with different radial orders. For further studies of body wave exploration by seismic interferometry, these differences should be considered.},

Reviewing recent results on the single crystal structure and elasticity of iron at core conditions, we find that an hcp structure with the fast c axis parallel to Earth's rotation is more likely but a body-centered cubic structure with the [111] axis aligned in that direction results in very similar predictions for seismic anisotropy. These models are therefore not distinguishable based on current seismological data. In addition, to match the seismological observations, the inferred strength of anisotropy in the {IMIC} (6–7\%) implies almost perfect alignment of iron crystals, an intriguing, albeit unlikely situation, especially in the presence of heterogeneity, which calls for further studies.},

There is a well defined hemispherical dichotomy in anisotropy and attenuation, and significant variations in the radial direction, with weaker anisotropy in the uppermost regions, and possibly different properties in an “innermost inner core” of radius 300–600km. Perhaps even more puzzling is the observation of a stably stratified layer at the base of the outer core, which has recently been proposed to result from melting of inner core material. If confirmed, the presence of this layer has major implications for our understanding of convection in the outer core. Inner core differential rotation with respect to the mantle remains controversial. We will review here recent progress in understanding the dynamics of the inner core. A number of different models have been proposed for the development of the inner core's structure and formation of the stable layer at the base of the outer core, and particular care will be taken to clarify under which conditions the proposed mechanisms can be active.},

The existence of hemispherical variations used to be controversial, but there is now strong evidence from both seismic body wave and normal mode observations, showing stronger anisotropy, less attenuation, and a lower isotropic velocity in the western hemisphere. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the hemispherical pattern: either (a) inner core translation, wherein one hemisphere is melting and the other is solidifying, or (b) thermochemical convection in the outer core, leading to different solidification conditions at the inner core boundary. Neither is (yet) able to explain all seismically observed features, and a combination of different mechanisms is probably required.},

Hemispherical anisotropic patterns of the solid Earth’s core are rather complex, and the commonly used hexagonal-close-packed iron phase might be insufficient to account for seismological observations. We show that the data we collected are in good agreement with the presence of two anisotropically specular east and west core hemispheres. The detected travel-time anomalies can only be disclosed by a lattice-preferred orientation of a body-centered-cubic iron aggregate, having a fraction of their [111] crystal axes parallel to the Earth’s rotation axis.

	abstract = {The days when the Earth's inner core ({IC}) was viewed as a homogeneous solid sphere surrounded by the liquid outer core ({OC}) are now behind us. Due to a limited number of data sampling the {IC} and a lack of experimentally controlled conditions in the deep Earth studies, it has been difficult to scrutinize competitive hypotheses in this active area of research. However, a number of new concepts linking {IC} structure and dynamics has been proposed lately to explain different types of seismological observations. A common denominator of recent observational work on the {IC} is increased complexity seen in {IC} physical properties such as its isotropic and anisotropic structure, attenuation, inner core boundary ({ICB}) topography, and its rotational dynamics. For example, small-scale features have been observed to exist as a widespread phenomenon in the uppermost inner core, probably superimposed on much longer-scale features. The characterization of small-scale features sheds light on the nature of the solidification process and helps in understanding seismologically observed hemispherical dichotomy of the {IC}. The existence of variations in the rate and level of solidification is a plausible physical outcome in an environment where vigorous compositional convection in the {OC} and variations in heat exchange across the {ICB} may control the process of crystal growth. However, further progress is hindered by the fact that the current traveltime data of {PKIKP} waves traversing the {IC} do not allow discriminating between variations in isotropic P wave velocity and velocity anisotropy. Future studies of attenuation in the {IC} might provide crucial information about {IC} structure, although another trade-off exists—that of the relative contribution of scattering versus viscoelastic attenuation and the connection with the material properties. Future installations of dense arrays, cross paths of waves that sample the {IC}, and corresponding array studies will be a powerful tool to image and clearly distinguish between viscoelastic and scattering attenuation, and isotropic- and anisotropic-heterogeneity related effects on traveltimes of core-sensitive body waves. This will then inevitably contribute to a better understanding of what the {IC} is made of, how it solidifies and how it contributes to the generation and dynamics of the geomagnetic field.},

Results confirm degree-one velocity structure in the inner core whose fast and slow regions appear to be separated by transitions with a velocity contrast of about 1\%. Although attenuation in the inner core also exhibits degree-one pattern, a high attenuation region (Qp−1=[0.002,0.0067]) extends to the central Pacific, which has been previously considered a part of the western hemisphere characterized by slower velocity and lower attenuation. The rest of the inner core exhibits a positive correlation between velocity and attenuation as observed previously. An observed mantle-like relationship between velocity and attenuation in the central Pacific can be interpreted as originating from higher than average homologous temperature, consistent with a model of inner core solidification driven by outer core convection coupled to core–mantle boundary thermal heterogeneity. Alternative mechanisms, including differences in grain size and impurity concentration, and lateral differences in solidification rate might be required to explain the structure of the inner core. The F region velocity and attenuation are best explained by the {AK}135-F velocity model and Qp−1=[0,0.001] respectively.},

We show that seismological data are best explained by a rather complicated, mosaic-like, structure of the inner core, where well-separated patches of different iron crystals compose the anisotropic western hemispherical region and a conglomerate of almost indistinguishable iron phases builds-up the weakly anisotropic eastern side.},

However, seismic and mineral physics observations of the polarized Vs are still emerging. Thus far, the Vs anisotropy of the constitute iron crystals at relevant pressures of the Earth's core has remained mostly theoretical mainly because of the technical difficulties involved in measuring reliable Vs velocities of iron crystals. Here we have measured azimuthal Vs anisotropy of highly textured hcp-Fe at high pressures using nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, a technique sensitive to Vs, in a diamond anvil cell. Our results show that the azimuthal Vs is 2–4\% faster along the crystallographic c axis than along the a axis at 158GPa and 172GPa. If one describes the Vp anisotropy of the inner core as a result of the textured hcp-Fe crystals, it is conceivable that azimuthal and polarized Vs anisotropies with a magnitude of a few percent also exist in the region. Since Vp and Vs of candidate iron phases behave quite differently in theoretical predictions, our results here indicate that future seismic observations of the Vs and Vp anisotropies of the inner core thus hold the key to deciphering the causes for the seismic and dynamic signatures as well as constitute iron phase(s) of the region.},

Also, for the first time, a clear waveform of {PKJKP} was observed. This gives us an unprecedented opportunity to put constraints on the shear wave attenuation in the earth's inner core using body waves. In order to minimize the potential influence of dispersion and phase shift caused by mantle heterogeneity, we adopt an envelope modeling approach. Our results show that the estimated Qβ from the shear phase {PKJKP} is significantly larger (∼315 ± 150) than that from normal mode observations. Because {PKJKP} samples the deep inner core, this indicates an increase of Qβ with depth in the inner core, in agreement with what is generally observed for Qα.},

Thus, new techniques to observe different types of inner core waves are imperative to improve data coverage. Here, we detail our method for detecting exotic inner core phases such as {PKJKP} and {PKIIKP}, using inner core compressional waves as proof of concept. We use phase weighted stacking on long period data from a global distribution of stations, and employ several synthetic methods, including normal mode summation and {SPECFEM}, to identify and confirm the inner core phases. We present evidence for two observations of exotic inner core compressional waves, and apply the technique to a previously detected inner core shear wave. A possible new inner core shear wave remains unconfirmed. Additionally, we show how our method is important for rejecting potential observations, and distinguishing between waves with similar traveltime and slowness. The method is most successful for detecting exotic inner core compressional waves, and will provide a new approach for studying the compressional wave structures in the upper inner core.},

In the past, this mode pair has been used to try to resolve the debate on whether the inner core is strongly or weakly attenuating. Its large spectral amplitude in observed data, possible through the apparent low attenuation of 10S2, has been explained as evidence of a weakly attenuating inner core. However, this contradicted body waves and other normal modes studies, which resulted in this pair of modes being excluded from inner core modelling. Modes 10S2 and 11S2 are difficult to measure and interpret because they depend strongly on the underlying 1-D model used. This strong dependence makes these modes change both their oscillation characteristics and attenuation values under a small 1-D perturbation to the inner core model. Here, we include this effect by allowing the pair of modes to cross-couple or resonate through 1-D structure and treat them as one hybrid mode. We find that, unlike previously thought, the source of 10S2 visibility is its strong cross-coupling to 11S2 for both 1-D elastic and anelastic structure. We also observe that the required 1-D perturbation is much smaller than the 2 per cent vs perturbation previously suggested, because we simultaneously measure 3-D structure in addition to 1-D structure. Only a 0.5 per cent increase in inner core vs or a 0.5 per cent decrease in inner core radius is required to explain 10S2–11S2 observations and a weakly attenuating inner core is not needed. In addition, the 3-D structure measurements of mode 10S2 and its cross-coupling to 11S2 show the typical strong zonal splitting pattern attributed to inner core cylindrical anisotropy, allowing us to add further constrains to deeper regions of the inner core.},

These observations, together with reports of the differential rotation5 of the inner core, have generated considerable interest in the physical state and dynamics of the inner core, and in the structure and elasticity of its main constituent, iron, at appropriate conditions of pressure and temperature. Here we report first-principles calculations of the structure and elasticity of dense hexagonal close-packed (h.c.p.) iron at high temperatures. We find that the axial ratio c/a of h.c.p. iron increases substantially with increasing temperature, reaching a value of nearly 1.7 at a temperature of 5,700 K, where aggregate bulk and shear moduli match those of the inner core. As a consequence of the increasing c/a ratio, we have found that the single-crystal longitudinal anisotropy of h.c.p. iron at high temperature has the opposite sense from that at low temperature6,7. By combining our results with a simple model of polycrystalline texture in the inner core, in which basal planes are partially aligned with the rotation axis, we can account for seismological observations of inner-core anisotropy.},

Earth's inner core is thought to be solid, which means it should support shear waves. However, the small size of the inner core makes detecting shear waves very difficult. Tkalčić and Phạm correlated different types of seismic phases to finally determine the speed of shear waves in Earth's inner core (see the Perspective by Irving). The detection of the waves closes an 80-year quest to find them and confirms a solid, but soft, inner core.
Science, this issue p. 329; see also p. 294
Seismic J waves, shear waves that traverse Earth’s inner core, provide direct constraints on the inner core’s solidity and shear properties. However, these waves have been elusive in the direct seismic wavefield because of their small amplitudes. We devised a new method to detect J waves in the earthquake coda correlation wavefield. They manifest through the similarity with other compressional core-sensitive signals. The inner core is solid, but relatively soft, with shear-wave speeds and shear moduli of 3.42 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 149.0 ± 1.6 gigapascals ({GPa}) near the inner core boundary and 3.58 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 167.4 ± 1.6 {GPa} in Earth’s center. The values are 2.5\% lower than the widely used Preliminary Earth Reference Model. This provides new constraints on the dynamical interpretation of Earth’s inner core.
The detection of shear waves through Earth’s inner core confirms that it is solid but soft.

	abstract = {The term seismic interferometry refers to the principle of generating new seismic responses by crosscorrelating seismic observations at different receiver locations. The first version of this principle was derived by Claerbout (1968), who showed that the reflection response of a horizontally layered medium can be synthesized from the autocorrelation of its transmission response. For an arbitrary 3D inhomogeneous lossless medium it follows from Rayleigh’s reciprocity theorem and the principle of time-reversal invariance that the acoustic Green’s function between any two points in the medium can be represented by an integral of crosscorrelations of wavefield observations at those two points. The integral is along sources on an arbitrarily shaped surface enclosing these points. No assumptions are made with respect to the diffusivity of the wavefield. The Rayleigh-Betti reciprocity theorem leads to a similar representation of the elastodynamic Green’s function. When a part of the enclosing surface is the earth’s free surface, the integral needs only to be evaluated over the remaining part of the closed surface. In practice, not all sources are equally important: The main contributions to the reconstructed Green’s function come from sources at stationary points. When the sources emit transient signals, a shaping filter can be applied to correct for the differences in source wavelets. When the sources are uncorrelated noise sources, the representation simplifies to a direct crosscorrelation of wavefield observations at two points, similar as in methods that retrieve Green’s functions from diffuse wavefields in disordered media or in finite media with an irregular bounding surface.},

The interval from 3 to 10 h after the onset of major earthquakes is employed for the period range from 15 to 50 s. The observations can be well matched by synthetic seismograms for a radially stratified Earth. Many of the correlation phases have similar time behaviour to those in the regular wavefield, but others have no correspondence. All such correlation phases can be explained by the interaction of arrivals with a common slowness at the each of the stations being correlated. Using a generalized ray description of the seismic wavefield, the time-distance behaviour of these correlation phases arises from differences in accumulated phase on different propagation paths through the Earth. Distinct arrivals emerge from the correlation field when there are many ways in which combinations of seismic phases can arise with the same difference in propagation legs. The constituents of the late coda are dominated by steeply travelling waves, and in consequence features associated with multiple passages through the whole Earth emerge distinctly, such as high-order multiples of {PKIKP}.},

	abstract = {Since their development in the 1960s, seismic arrays have given a new impulse to seismology. Recordings from many uniform seismometers in a well-defined, closely spaced configuration produce high-quality and homogeneous data sets, which can be used to study the Earth's structure in great detail. Apart from an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio due to the simple summation of the individual array recordings, seismological arrays can be used in many different ways to study the fine-scale structure of the Earth's interior. They have helped to study such different structures as the interior of volcanos, continental crust and lithosphere, global variations of seismic velocities in the mantle, the core-mantle boundary and the structure of the inner core. For this purpose many different, specialized array techniques have been developed and applied to an increasing number of high-quality array data sets. Most array methods use the ability of seismic arrays to measure the vector velocity of an incident wave front, i.e., slowness and back azimuth. This information can be used to distinguish between different seismic phases, separate waves from different seismic events and improve the signal-to-noise ratio by stacking with respect to the varying slowness of different phases. The vector velocity information of scattered or reflected phases can be used to determine the region of the Earth from whence the seismic energy comes and with what structures it interacted. Therefore seismic arrays are perfectly suited to study the small-scale structure and variations of the material properties of the Earth. In this review we will give an introduction to various array techniques which have been developed since the 1960s. For each of these array techniques we give the basic mathematical equations and show examples of applications. The advantages and disadvantages and the appropriate applications and restrictions of the techniques will also be discussed. The main methods discussed are the beam-forming method, which forms the basis for several other methods, different slant stacking techniques, and frequency–wave number analysis. Finally, some methods used in exploration geophysics that have been adopted for global seismology are introduced. This is followed by a description of temporary and permanent arrays installed in the past, as well as existing arrays and seismic networks. We highlight their purposes and discuss briefly the advantages and disadvantages of different array configurations.},

	abstract = {Surface waves in seismic noise correlation functions are routinely exploited for tomographic studies. However, the observation and proper interpretation of body waves is considerably more difficult. To understand body wave generation in particular and the emergence of noise correlation signals in general, we investigate the sensitivity of correlation functions with respect to global noise sources. Treating noise correlation functions as self-consistent observables, without the enforcement of Green function retrieval, enables us to investigate the quantitative contribution of different noise sources in space to a signal in a specific time window. The source sensitivity kernel for a surface wave reveals the expected dominant and broad region of stationary phase and thereby confirms the robustness of noise tomography in its current state. In contrast, kernels for potential body waves are highly oscillatory and indicate significant contributions from cross terms, for example, from body wave-surface wave interactions. While the short-wavelength nature of the body wave kernel may in the future allow us to infer noise sources with great detail, the importance of cross terms combined with the natural heterogeneity of noise sources renders an interpretation of such an arrival as a pure body wave almost impossible. Furthermore, we show that even long-wavelength Earth structure significantly distorts sensitivity kernels. It is therefore essential to incorporate 3-D heterogeneities into high-resolution imaging of ambient noise sources, especially at higher frequencies.},

	abstract = {We develop a general theory for interferometry by correlation that (i) properly accounts for heterogeneously distributed sources of continuous or transient nature, (ii) fully incorporates any type of linear and nonlinear processing, such as one-bit normalization, spectral whitening and phase-weighted stacking, (iii) operates for any type of medium, including 3-D elastic, heterogeneous and attenuating media, (iv) enables the exploitation of complete correlation waveforms, including seemingly unphysical arrivals, and (v) unifies the earthquake-based two-station method and ambient noise correlations. Our central theme is not to equate interferometry with Green function retrieval, and to extract information directly from processed interstation correlations, regardless of their relation to the Green function. We demonstrate that processing transforms the actual wavefield sources and actual wave propagation physics into effective sources and effective wave propagation. This transformation is uniquely determined by the processing applied to the observed data, and can be easily computed. The effective forward model, that links effective sources and propagation to synthetic interstation correlations, may not be perfect. A forward modelling error, induced by processing, describes the extent to which processed correlations can actually be interpreted as proper correlations, that is, as resulting from some effective source and some effective wave propagation. The magnitude of the forward modelling error is controlled by the processing scheme and the temporal variability of the sources. Applying adjoint techniques to the effective forward model, we derive finite-frequency Fréchet kernels for the sources of the wavefield and Earth structure, that should be inverted jointly. The structure kernels depend on the sources of the wavefield and the processing scheme applied to the raw data. Therefore, both must be taken into account correctly in order to make accurate inferences on Earth structure. Not making any restrictive assumptions on the nature of the wavefield sources, our theory can be applied to earthquake and ambient noise data, either separately or combined. This allows us (i) to locate earthquakes using interstation correlations and without knowledge of the origin time, (ii) to unify the earthquake-based two-station method and noise correlations without the need to exclude either of the two data types, and (iii) to eliminate the requirement to remove earthquake signals from noise recordings prior to the computation of correlation functions. In addition to the basic theory for acoustic wavefields, we present numerical examples for 2-D media, an extension to the most general viscoelastic case, and a method for the design of optimal processing schemes that eliminate the forward modelling error completely. This work is intended to provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation of full-waveform interferometry by correlation, and to suggest improvements to current passive monitoring methods.},

Here we include a prescribed buoyancy force, which is geophysically more realistic, and also yields time-dependent rather than time-independent solutions. The field in the finitely conducting inner core does not then adjust instantaneously to the field in the outer core, but has a diffusive timescale of its own of a few thousand years. Rather large, rapid fluctuations in the outer core are then effectively averaged out by the inner core, producing a relatively stable external dipole field. We speculate that a geomagnetic reversal could only occur as a result of a particularly large fluctuation, large enough and lasting long enough to reverse the field throughout the inner core as well.},

	abstract = {The observed variation of the seismic velocities with depth, below the crust, is examined with reference to the variation to be expected in a homogeneous medium. A general equation is derived for the variation of the quantity, , in a homogeneous gravitating layer with an arbitrary gradient of temperature. The parameters of this equation are then discussed in terms of the experimental and theoretical relations for solids. The principal parameter is (∂{KT}/∂P)T, the rate of change of isothermal incompressibility with pressure, which can be found for large compressions from Bridgman's measurements. Comparison of observed and expected rates of variation of ϕ throughout the Earth's interior leads to conclusions regarding homogeneity and, with a larger uncertainty, to estimates of temperature. A shadow zone at a depth of about 100 km, as suggested by Gutenberg, may be accounted for by a gradient of temperature of about 6°/km in a homogeneous layer of ultrabasic rock. Between depths of about 900 and 2,900 km, the mantle appears to be substantially uniform, and at a relatively uniform temperature of the order of several thousand degrees. Between about 200 and 900 km, the rate of rise of velocity is too great for a homogeneous layer, and indicates a gradual change of composition, or of phase, or both. New phases are required to account for the high elasticity of the deeper part of the mantle (below 900 km), and it is suggested that, beginning at about 200 to 300 km, there is a gradual shift toward high-pressure modifications of the ferro-magnesian silicates, probably close-packed oxides, with the transition complete at about 800 to 900 km. There may also be a concentration of alumina, lime, and alkalis toward the upper part of the mantle, in and above the transitional layer but below the crust, existing in minerals of high elasticity such as garnets and jadeites. The transitional layer appears to hold the key to a number of major geophysical problems. The velocities in the core and inner core are also reviewed. The inner core is most simply interpreted as crystalline iron, the outer part as liquid iron, perhaps alloyed with a small fraction of lighter elements. The density and compressibility of iron at high pressures are estimated with the aid of the experimental compressions of the alkali metals; the central density is found to be about 15. Several other recent proposals regarding the crust are discussed.},

Directional phonon measurements from inelastic X-ray scattering on a sample with lattice preferred orientation at 52 {GPa} in a diamond anvil cell were coupled with X-ray diffraction data to determine the elastic tensor. Comparison of the results from this new method with the elasticity determined by lattice strain analysis of radial X-ray diffraction measurements showed significant differences, highlighting the importance of strength anisotropy in hcp Fe. At 52 {GPa}, we found that a method which combines results from inelastic scattering and pressure-volume measurements gives a shape in the velocity anisotropy close to sigmoidal (with a faster c and slower a axis) a smaller magnitude in the anisotropy and compared to velocities based on the lattice strain method which gives a bell shape velocity distribution with the fast direction between the c and a axes. We used additional results from nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to constrain errors and provide additional validation of the accuracy of our results.},

	abstract = {During the last decade, the presence of velocity anisotropy inside the inner core, with a fast axis parallel to the Earth's rotation axis, has been well established. The quantitative analysis of the amplitudes of waves which sample a particular region of the inner core, under Africa, but exhibit various orientations allows us to document and characterize the presence of anisotropy in attenuation. The analysis is based on a comparison of both amplitudes and travel times of the {PKP}({DF}) wave, which samples the inner core, and the {PKP}({BC}) wave, which has nearly the same path but bottoms inside the liquid core. The data reveal that the direction of strong attenuation correlates with that of fast velocity. When referred to the same epicentral distance and focal depth, the {PKP}({DF})/{PKP}({BC}) amplitude ratio are about five times lower for paths tilted by 25° with respect to the Earth rotation axis, than for nearly equatorial paths. A clear negative correlation is observed between travel time and amplitude residuals, when the angle to Earth rotation axis varies. This first quantitative analysis, combined with experimental results on oriented crystals and mushy media, may bring important constraints on the mechanism responsible for anisotropy in the inner core.},

Normally, when estimating the elastic properties of a polycrystal, one calculates an average over different orientations of a single crystal. This approach does not take into account the grain boundaries and defects that are likely to be abundant at high temperatures relevant for the inner core conditions. By using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that, if defects are considered, the calculated shear modulus and shear wave velocity decrease dramatically as compared to those estimates obtained from the averaged single-crystal values. Thus, the low shear wave velocity in the inner core is explained.
Molecular simulations suggest that crystal defects, rather than melting, may explain the low rigidity and shear wave velocities of the Earth's inner core.

The high attenuation of sound wave propagation in the inner core is at odds with the widely accepted paradigm of hexagonal close-packed phase stability under inner core conditions, because sound waves propagate through the hexagonal iron without energy dissipation. Here we show by first-principles molecular dynamics that the body-centered cubic phase of iron, recently demonstrated to be thermodynamically stable under the inner core conditions, is considerably less elastic than the hexagonal phase. Being a crystalline phase, the body-centered cubic phase of iron possesses the viscosity close to that of a liquid iron. The high attenuation of sound in the inner core is due to the unique diffusion characteristic of the body-centered cubic phase. The low viscosity of iron in the inner core enables the convection and resolves a number of controversies.},

Laboratory experiments1 suggest the possibility of an uncharacterized phase transformation in iron at core conditions and seismological observations2,3,4 have indicated the possible presence of complex, inner-core layering. Theoretical studies5,6 currently suggest that the hexagonal close packed (h.c.p.) phase of iron is stable at core pressures and that the body centred cubic (b.c.c.) phase of iron becomes elastically unstable at high pressure. In other h.c.p. metals, however, a high-pressure b.c.c. form has been found to become stabilized at high temperature. We report here a quantum mechanical study of b.c.c.-iron able to model its behaviour at core temperatures as well as pressures, using ab initio molecular dynamics free-energy calculations. We find that b.c.c.-iron indeed becomes entropically stabilized at core temperatures, but in its pure state h.c.p.-iron still remains thermodynamically more favourable. The inner core, however, is not pure iron, and our calculations indicate that the b.c.c. phase will be stabilized with respect to the h.c.p. phase by sulphur or silicon impurities in the core. Consequently, a b.c.c.-structured alloy may be a strong candidate for explaining the observed seismic complexity of the inner core2,3,4.},

Here, we apply inter-source interferometry, which converts deep earthquakes into virtual seismometers, to detect the seismic signature of {MOW} without influence from shallow heterogeneities. With data from the Hi-net, we confirm the existence of {MOW} beneath the Japan Sea and constrain its geometry to be 30 km thick at 410-km depth and gradually thinning to a depth of 580 km at least. Our result supports transformational faulting of metastable olivine as the initiation mechanism of deep earthquakes, although large events (M7.0+) probably rupture beyond the wedge. Furthermore, the slab core must be dehydrated at shallower depth and only transports negligible amount of water into the transition zone.},

In this study, we applied the technique to seismograms of earthquakes that occurred at depths of 300–500 km beneath the Bonin Islands. The wavelets of direct P- and S-waves generated by the deep earthquakes were examined to compute cross-correlation functions ({CCFs}). We stacked the {CCFs} observed at receivers around the stationary point whose location could be estimated by the ray tracing technique, because the phases in such {CCFs} potentially emerge at similar lag times; that is the stationary phases. The results demonstrate the retrieval of direct P- and S-waves propagating between pairs of deep earthquakes; in particular, direct P waves are reconstructed for most event pairs. The following points should be considered to effectively retrieve the propagation of body waves: (1) it is important to design a geometry in which the stationary phase derived from two earthquakes can be observed at the employed stations, (2) the lag time difference of the stationary phases that emerge in the employed {CCFs} should be as small as possible and (3) the direct waves associated with deep earthquakes have a large amplitude at stations employed for cross-correlation, which is accomplished by both low noise level at the stations and the radiation pattern of the sources.},

Furthermore, other seismological evidence, some of it pre-existing and some of it very recently discovered, militates against these models. Within the framework of isotropic earth models there appears to be no acceptable explanation of the modal observations. Here we show that anisotropy in the inner core can produce an effect which is of the correct magnitude and which varies from mode to mode in approximately the observed manner. The data currently available are insufficient to objectively map the anisotropy, but the simple assumption of a constant elastic tensor which is invariant under rotations about the Earth's rotation axis (i.e. is transversely isotropic in the plane of the equator) matches well the gross features of the modal observations. This model does not entirely reconcile the modal data with traveltime observations; it is argued, however, that there exists an anisotropic model which will do so.},

	abstract = {The core of the Earth is usually described by spherically-symmetrical velocity models. The core is made of two main spherical layers: the fluid outer core with a radius close to 3,480 km and a P-velocity increasing with depth from 8 km s−1 to 10.3 km s−1, and the solid inner core with a radius of 1,220 km and a P-velocity close to 11 km s−1 (refs 1, 2). Station residuals of the seismic core phase {PKIKP} have been computed for 400 seismological observatories worldwide using 5 yr of the International Seismological Centre ({ISC}) Bulletins. {PKIKP} travel times can be corrected for upper mantle propagation by subtracting P delays; thus {PKIKP}–P residuals are a measurement of the average vertical travel times in the lower mantle and in the core of the Earth beneath seismic stations. A spherical harmonic development of {PKIKP}–P delays up to degree 4 explains 58\% of the variance in the data. {PKIKP}–P exhibit a latitudinal dependence: polar stations tend to be faster than equatorial stations. We show here that this pattern may reflect a departure from spherical symmetry in the P-velocity distribution in the vicinity of the inner core boundary of the Earth.},

	abstract = {Ab initio finite temperature molecular dynamics simulations have been used to calculate the elastic constants of hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) Fe as a function of temperature at {\textasciitilde}300GPa. The longitudinal modulus c11 decreases with temperature, in stark contrast to previous calculations, but in agreement with experimental observations on other transition metals at ambient pressures. c33 and c44 also decrease with temperature, while c12 and c23 slightly increase. When these moduli are used to calculate P-wave velocities through the crystal, the sense of the anisotropy is such that {VP} is fastest along the c-axis up to 5000K; however, by 5500K the anisotropy reverses with {VP} becoming faster in the a–b plane. This suggests that, for an inner core dominated by crystals of hcp-Fe aligned with the c-axis in the polar direction, the observed isotropic outer–inner core could result from the hcp-Fe being at a temperature close to melting where the axial wave velocities parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis become similar, while at greater depths in the inner–inner core, where iron is further from melting, stronger anisotropy is achieved with the faster P-wave velocities parallel to the polar axis. No other mechanisms, such as changes in composition or crystal alignment, are therefore required to account for the observed change in seismic anisotropy of the Earth's inner core with depth.},

	abstract = {The inner core has the intriguing property that seismic waves traveling parallel to the Earth's spin axis arrive earlier than those traveling parallel to the equatorial plane. The travel time is some 6 s faster from pole to pole than across the equator. This difference is not the result of different polar and equatorial radii of the inner core, for it would require the inner core to be elongated at the poles by more than one third of its radius. Rather, this 6-s travel time difference is the result of the inner core's being anisotropic; wave speeds differ for different directions of wave propagation. This anisotropy, discovered only in the last decade, is characterized by cylindrical symmetry about an axis approximately aligned with the Earth's spin axis. The anisotropy is believed to be due to a preferred orientation of anisotropic iron crystals composing the inner core, but the mechanisms responsible for creating such a preferred orientation remain uncertain. With the anisotropy now well established as a basic property of the inner core, its quantification and that temporal variations of its orientation have become a vital tool for probing the structure, composition, and dynamics of the Earth's deep interior.},

This insight explains the origin and generation mechanism of the features of Earth's correlation wavefield and opens up new ways of addressing issues in global seismology.

It is first shown that fractional density and fractional seismic velocity variations are probably comparable, so that fluid dynamic arguments have relevance to seismic data. In regions of nearly neutral stability in the outer core, an analysis of convective vigour indicates an upper bound of δρ/ρ≲10−8. If the outer core possesses one or more layers of strong static stability then stationary contributions to δρ can be larger, if they are associated with axisymmetric (m = 0) harmonics, because of stabilizing zonal winds. Baroclinic instabilities nevertheless limit δρ/ρ≲ 10−6 but may not exist if the static stability is sufficiently large. Shear instabilities always limit δρ/ρ≲ 10−4. Magnetic field effects suggest comparable or more stringent upper bounds. It is concluded that scientists undertaking analysis of the Earth's geoid or seismic travel times or normal modes can safely assume that there are negligible lateral variations in the outer core.},

	abstract = {We present a growth tectonic model of Earth's inner core and the resulting model of the seismic anisotropy. The inner core grows anisotropically if the convection in the outer core is of Taylor column type. The anisotropic growth produces a flow field of the poloidal zonal order 2 type as a result of the isostatic adjustment of the viscous inner core. Crystals in the inner core align themselves under the stress field produced by the flow. We model the anisotropic structure of the inner core, using the theory of Kamb [1959] and elastic constants of Stixrude and Cohen [1995b]. We consider models for both hcp iron and fcc iron, which are the probable crystal structures for the inner core iron according to Stixrude and Cohen [1995a]. We have found that the c axis for hcp iron and [111] direction for fcc iron align in the polar direction. The alignment is consistent with seismic observations, which have revealed that the P wave velocity is faster in the polar direction. Our model predicts that the degree of the alignment decreases near the inner core boundary in accord with recent body wave observations. The radial dependence of the alignment would result from the following three effects: (1) crystals near the surface have not undergone stressed state long enough to acquire anisotropy after precipitation, (2) stress near the surface is different from that in the interior of the inner core due to shear stress free boundary condition, and (3) partially molten structure results in transversely isotropic stress condition near the inner core surface due to compaction. Thus the application of Kamb's theory successfully explains the seismic anisotropy in the inner core provided that the crystals have been subjected under the same stress condition for the timescale of the order of 109 years.},

Here we investigate the development of anisotropy as the inner core deforms plastically under the influence of electromagnetic (Maxwell) shear stresses. We estimate the flow caused by a representative magnetic field using polycrystal plasticity simulations for ε-iron, where the imposed deformation is accommodated by basal and prismatic slip11. We find that individual grains in an initially random polycrystal become preferentially oriented with their c axes parallel to the equatorial plane. This pattern is accentuated if deformation is accompanied by recrystallization. Using the single-crystal elastic properties of ε-iron at core pressure and temperature12, we average over the simulated orientation distribution to obtain a pattern of elastic anisotropy which is similar to that observed seismologically13,14.},

The data set was supplemented with a special study of 12 years of {ISC} phase data which yielded an additional 1.75 × 106 travel time observations for P and S waves. In order to obtain satisfactory agreement with the entire data set we were required to take into account anelastic dispersion. The introduction of transverse isotropy into the outer 220 km of the mantle was required in order to satisfy the shorter period fundamental toroidal and spheroidal modes. This anisotropy also improved the fit of the larger data set. The horizontal and vertical velocities in the upper mantle differ by 2–4\%, both for P and S waves. The mantle below 220 km is not required to be anisotropic. Mantle Rayleigh waves are surprisingly sensitive to compressional velocity in the upper mantle. High Sn velocities, low Pn velocities and a pronounced low-velocity zone are features of most global inversion models that are suppressed when anisotropy is allowed for in the inversion.

Specifically, within the innermost inner core, the slowest direction of wave propagation is ∼45° from the east-west direction. In contrast, the direction of the slowest wave propagation in the overlying inner core is east-west.

They interpreted this observation as revealing prolate topography of the inner-core boundary. In 1986, Morelli et al.2 and Woodhouse et al.3 suggested that inner-core anisotropy could explain both the travel-time observations and the anomalous splitting of some of the Earth's normal modes. Inner-core anisotropy continues to be the preferred explanation for the travel-time anomalies, although there is disagreement about the magnitude of anisotropy4–6. More recent explanations for the anomalous splitting involve topography of the inner-core and core–mantle boundaries as well as lateral heterogeneity of the core7–11. In particular, Widmer et al.11 dismissed a rather complex recent model of inner-core anisotropy12 because it could not explain the splitting of several previously unidentified modes. Here I show that the anomalous splitting of all currently identified modes can in fact be explained by cylindrical anisotropy of the Earth's inner core that is also compatible with the observed {PKIKP} travel-time anomalies. The resulting model should be regarded as an upper limit to the amount of anisotropy, as lateral heterogeneity also undoubtedly contributes to the splitting.},

	abstract = {The model of cylindrical anisotropy in the inner core ({IC}) states that seismic rays traveling parallel to the Earth's rotational axis travel faster than those parallel to the equator. There have been continuing discrepancies in estimates of the strength and orientation of anisotropy, with some evidence suggesting that such a model may not be supported by available data. Here, we scrutinize the radial dependence of anisotropy within the {IC}, where the nature of anisotropy has been shown to change anywhere between a 300 and 800 km radius. We use recent travel time data from the International Seismological Centre in conjunction with the neighborhood algorithm to provide a robust means of testing this idea, through examination of an ensemble of models that satisfactorily fit the data. This can be done with no explicit regularization and without the need for subjective choices associated with binning of phase data. In addition, uncertainty bounds are calculated for anisotropic parameters using a likelihood ratio approach. We find evidence to suggest that commonly employed spatial averaging (binning) methods may be detrimental to obtaining reliable results. We conclude that there is no significant change in the strength of anisotropy with depth in the {IC}. Instead, we find a change in the slow direction of anisotropy to 54° within the innermost {IC} at an ∼650 km radius with fast direction parallel to the Earth's rotational axis.},

	abstract = {{NASA}’s {InSight} (Interior exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) mission landed in Elysium Planitia on Mars on 26 November 2018. It aims to determine the interior structure, composition and thermal state of Mars, as well as constrain present-day seismicity and impact cratering rates. Such information is key to understanding the differentiation and subsequent thermal evolution of Mars, and thus the forces that shape the planet’s surface geology and volatile processes. Here we report an overview of the first ten months of geophysical observations by {InSight}. As of 30 September 2019, 174 seismic events have been recorded by the lander’s seismometer, including over 20 events of moment magnitude Mw = 3–4. The detections thus far are consistent with tectonic origins, with no impact-induced seismicity yet observed, and indicate a seismically active planet. An assessment of these detections suggests that the frequency of global seismic events below approximately Mw = 3 is similar to that of terrestrial intraplate seismic activity, but there are fewer larger quakes; no quakes exceeding Mw = 4 have been observed. The lander’s other instruments—two cameras, atmospheric pressure, temperature and wind sensors, a magnetometer and a radiometer—have yielded much more than the intended supporting data for seismometer noise characterization: magnetic field measurements indicate a local magnetic field that is ten-times stronger than orbital estimates and meteorological measurements reveal a more dynamic atmosphere than expected, hosting baroclinic and gravity waves and convective vortices. With the mission due to last for an entire Martian year or longer, these results will be built on by further measurements by the {InSight} lander.},

The mission aims to detect, characterize and locate seismic activity on Mars, and to further constrain the internal structure, composition and dynamics of the planet. Here, we present seismometer data recorded until 30 September 2019, which reveal that Mars is seismically active. We identify 174 marsquakes, comprising two distinct populations: 150 small-magnitude, high-frequency events with waves propagating at crustal depths and 24 low-frequency, subcrustal events of magnitude Mw 3–4 with waves propagating at various depths in the mantle. These marsquakes have spectral characteristics similar to the seismicity observed on the Earth and Moon. We determine that two of the largest detected marsquakes were located near the Cerberus Fossae fracture system. From the recorded seismicity, we constrain attenuation in the crust and mantle, and find indications of a potential low-S-wave-velocity layer in the upper mantle.},

	abstract = {The instrument package {SEIS} (Seismic Experiment for Internal Structure) with the three very broadband and three short-period seismic sensors is installed on the surface on Mars as part of {NASA}'s {InSight} Discovery mission. When compared to terrestrial installations, {SEIS} is deployed in a very harsh wind and temperature environment that leads to inevitable degradation of the quality of the recorded data. One ubiquitous artifact in the raw data is an abundance of transient one-sided pulses often accompanied by high-frequency spikes. These pulses, which we term “glitches”, can be modeled as the response of the instrument to a step in acceleration, while the spikes can be modeled as the response to a simultaneous step in displacement. We attribute the glitches primarily to {SEIS}-internal stress relaxations caused by the large temperature variations to which the instrument is exposed during a Martian day. Only a small fraction of glitches correspond to a motion of the {SEIS} package as a whole caused by minuscule tilts of either the instrument or the ground. In this study, we focus on the analysis of the glitch+spike phenomenon and present how these signals can be automatically detected and removed from {SEIS}'s raw data. As glitches affect many standard seismological analysis methods such as receiver functions, spectral decomposition and source inversions, we anticipate that studies of the Martian seismicity as well as studies of Mars' internal structure should benefit from deglitched seismic data.},

	abstract = {We used a terrestrial single-station seismometer to quantify the uncertainty of {InSight} ({INterior} explorations using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) data for determining Martian core size. To mimic Martian seismicity, we formed a catalog using 917 terrestrial earthquakes, from which we randomly selected events. We stacked {ScS} amplitudes on modeled arrival times and searched for where {ScS} produced coherent seismic amplitudes. A core detection was defined by a coherent peak with small offset between predicted and user-selected arrival times. Iterating the detection algorithm with varying signal-to-noise ({SNR}) ranges and quantity of events determined the selection frequency of each model and quantified core depth uncertainty. Increasing the quantity of events reduced core depth uncertainty while increasing the recovery rate, while increasing event {SNR} had little effect. Including {ScS}2 multiples increased the recovery rate and reduced core depth uncertainty when we used low quantities of events. The most-frequent core depths varied by back azimuth, suggesting our method is sensitive to the presence of mantle heterogeneities. When we added 1° in source distance errors, core depth uncertainty increased by up to 11 km and recovery rates decreased by {\textless}5\%. Altering epicentral distances by 25\% added {\textasciitilde}35 km of uncertainty and reduced recovery rates to {\textless}50\% in some cases. From these experiments, we estimate that if {InSight} can detect five events with high location precision ({\textless}10\% epicentral distance errors), that there is at least an 88\% chance of core depth recovery using {ScS} alone with uncertainty in core depth approaching 18 km and decreasing as more events are located.
Plain language summary
We used a seismometer on Earth to study how well the {NASA} mission, {InSight} ({INterior} explorations using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) could detect the Martian core. We created a catalog of earthquakes from which we randomly selected events to mimic the seismic events (marsquakes) {InSight} is expected to detect. Several models of Earth's interior were tested to see which best predicted the arrival of seismic waves reflecting off the core. We found utilizing more events allowed us to determine the core size better than using a limited number of events. Using an additional seismic phase also helped us recover a more accurate core depth if there were not a lot of events. We were also able to find variations in the mantle by using events within certain location ranges. Since the {InSight} team may not be able to locate marsquakes as accurately as we locate earthquakes, we changed the location of the earthquakes. When changes in location were small, we were still able to determine the size of the core. Larger changes in location prevented us from finding an accurate core depth. If {InSight} detects at least five events with high location accuracy, we will be able to determine the Martian core size.},

Heterogeneity was examined using {PKP}({DF}) and {PKP}({BC}) phases traveling in the east-west direction (E-W paths). The geographical pattern of the {PKP} differential travel time ({BC}-{DF}) residuals was found to be a manifestation of degree one heterogeneity in the outermost 100 to 500 km of the inner core. Spherical harmonics analysis showed that the P velocities in the inner core are fast in the region from 43°E to 177°E (the quasi-eastern hemisphere) with a peak value of +0.29±0.15\% and slow in the region from 183°W to 43°E (the quasi-western hemisphere) with a peak value of −0.66±0.20\%. Regional variation of anisotropy in the inner core was examined using {PKP} phases traveling nearly parallel to the Earth's spin axis (polar paths). The averages of {BC}–{DF} time residuals were 2.4±0.8 s in the quasi-western hemisphere and 0.5±0.4 s in the quasi-eastern hemisphere. We found that the inner core anisotropy predominates only in the quasi-western hemisphere in which the 0.66\% slow P velocity is observed for the E-W paths. Geophysical implications of the degree one pattern in the inner core were briefly discussed. We propose that the hemispherical structure of the inner core reflects ancient core dynamics immediately after core formation.},

Here we present constraints on seismic velocity variations just beneath the inner-core boundary, determined from the difference in travel time between waves reflected at the inner-core boundary and those transmitted through the inner core. We found that these travel-time residuals—observed on both global seismograph stations and several regional seismic networks—are systematically larger, by about 0.8 s, for waves that sample the ‘eastern hemisphere’ of the inner core (40° E to 180° E) compared to those that sample the ‘western hemisphere’ (180° W to 40° E). These residuals show no correlation with the angle at which the waves traverse the inner core; this indicates that seismic anisotropy is not strong in this region and that the isotropic seismic velocity of the eastern hemisphere is about 0.8\% higher than that of the western hemisphere.},

The uppermost layers are a region of particular importance, as they are directly linked to the growth processes and post-solidification mechanisms of the inner core. Here, we use a large {PKIKP}-{PKiKP} differential travel time residual data set to derive a model for the upper inner core, providing new constraints on its isotropic and anisotropic velocity, and the amount of scattering. We find that the eastern and western hemisphere are separated by sharp boundaries. This is incompatible with the recently proposed inner core translation model, but might be explained by differences in outer core convection and inner core solidification rates. The eastern hemisphere displays weak anisotropy of 0.5\%–1.0\%. The western hemisphere, on the other hand, is characterized by the presence of an isotropic upper layer with a thickness of 57.5 km, with anisotropy of 2.8\% appearing at deeper depths. The boundary between the isotropic layer and the deeper anisotropy appears sharp. We also detect, for the first time, a high velocity layer at the top of the eastern hemisphere with a thickness of 30 km, which we interpret as being due to an increased amount of light elements. There appears to be no relationship between the layered structure in the two hemispheres, with abrupt changes in velocity with depth in one hemisphere without any significant change at the same depth in the other hemisphere. Our results indicate that there is a difference in composition and mineral structure between the hemispheres, resulting in differing responses to external processes.},

The anisotropy displays axial symmetry around the Earth's spin axis, with the polar direction 3\% faster than the equatorial direction. One key problem now is the depth dependence of the inner core anisotropy. Here we extend our polar path studies to include both long-period and short-period modeling for the {PKP} phases at ranges 120° to 173°. Arrivals from the top of the inner core ({PKIKP}) and reflections from the inner core boundary ({PKiKP}) can be observed distinctly in short-period records at ranges 130° to 140° and as waveform distortions in the long-period records at ranges 130° to 146°. These waveforms provide a new set of data for examining the topmost 150 km of the inner core, which is not well sampled by the previous body wave travel times. Record sections of waves traversing the inner core nearly parallel to the Earth's spin axis (polar paths) from three events, two beneath the South Sandwich Islands and one along the Macquarie Ridge, recorded at World Wide Standardized Seismograph Network, Canadian Network, and Long Range Seismic Measurements stations are analyzed. Our results suggest that the top 150 km of the inner core is only weakly anisotropic (less than 1\%), with strong evidence indicating that the top 60 km is not anisotropic at all.},

	abstract = {I analyze nearly 2000 handpicked differential times of core-penetrating compressional waves to image lateral variations in the anisotropic structure of the solid inner core. The inner core is strongly anisotropic (2–4\% on average) throughout most of the western hemisphere from near the surface to its center and into the lowermost several hundred kilometers of the eastern hemisphere. In contrast, the outer half of the eastern hemisphere from 40° to 160°E (the quasi-eastern hemisphere) exhibits very weak anisotropy with an average amplitude of only 0.5\%. The symmetry direction is the fast direction and lies on or near the spin axis. Voigt's isotropic average of compressional wave speeds is the same in the eastern and western hemispheres, suggesting that there are no large-scale lateral variations in the chemistry or temperature in the inner core. Instead, I suggest that the variations seen in anisotropy represent lateral variations in the degree of crystal alignment. The inner core appears to be organized in a very simple way with 60–90\% of its volume containing well-aligned crystals and the remaining part (uppermost 400–700 km of the quasi-eastern hemisphere) containing less well aligned crystals. A mechanism consistent with axisymmetry and large-scale variability of anisotropy is discussed. It incorporates the inference that the inner core is rotating faster than the mantle and that gravitational coupling to the mantle forces large-scale inner core deformation, inducing flow with strain rates as high as 10−14 s−1. A positive feedback mechanism, related to anisotropic viscosity, may reinforce lateral variations in the strength of anisotropy.},

	abstract = {{PKP}({DF}) travel times reported by the International Seismological Centre ({ISC}) are analyzed to study the depth dependence of inner core anisotropy. Plots of {PKP}({DF}) travel time residuals versus range for different subsets of the data clearly show large anomalies at ranges beyond about 149° for those paths with inner core ray angles within 30° of the rotation axis. On average, the times are about 3 to 5 s earlier for these paths than for rays at other angles, consistent with recent waveform measurements of anomalous {PKP}({DF}) times by Creager (1992) and Song and Helmberger (1993), and indicative of inner core anisotropy in which the P velocity is about 3\% faster for N-S paths than E-W paths. The size of these apparent anomalies in the {ISC} data are much larger than those inferred from several previous analyses of {ISC} {PKP}({DF}) data which indicated 0.5 to 2 s anomalies at these ranges. The earlier studies applied binning and averaging schemes to the data using windows that were overly tight, thus excluding some of the most anomalous data points and biasing the results toward smaller anomalies. To avoid this problem, I apply a method for computing summary ray residuals that finds the maxima in smoothed histograms of the residuals and does not rely on a fixed interval to window the data points. Standard errors on each summary ray residual are estimated using a bootstrap technique that randomly resamples the data. Plots of the summary ray residuals for several range intervals reveal a small number of independent paths nearly parallel to the rotation axis for which the arrivals are 3 to 5 s early. Although the data are sparse for paths within 30° of the rotation axis, anisotropy does not appear to diminish with depth within the inner core and may cause a much larger anomaly near 180° than the 2-s value obtained in several prior studies of {ISC} data. The uniform anisotropy models of Creager (1992) and Song and Helmberger (1993) fit the bulk of the data reasonably well. However, the observed residuals at ranges between 132° and 140° are smaller than those predicted by most anisotropy models, suggesting that the anisotropy may diminish within the outermost 50 km of the inner core.},

Anisotropic structures are likely to be formed by dynamic processes and therefore such observations have the potential to provide constraints on flow in the inner core and on the geodynamo itself. But in addition to the difficulties in estimating the relevant physical properties of iron under inner-core conditions2,3,4, even the macroscopic processes responsible for generating seismic anisotropy in this region have yet to be determined5,6,7,8,9. As a result, the geodynamic significance of seismic anisotropy in the inner core has remained unknown. Here I propose—based on geodynamic and mineral physics considerations—that flow induced by the stress due to the magnetic field, the Maxwell stress, near the inner-core boundary produces an axisymmetric fabric responsible for the observed seismic anisotropy. The resultant seismic anisotropy reflects the geometry of the magnetic field near the inner-core boundary and therefore seismological observations might provide constraints on the geodynamo. This flow also causes non-uniform release of energy at the inner-core boundary, associated with solidification and melting which may affect the pattern of convection in the outer core.},

	abstract = {We propose to model the uppermost inner core as an aggregate of randomly oriented anisotropic “patches”. A patch is defined as an assemblage of a possibly large number of crystals with identically oriented crystallographic axes. This simple model accounts for the observed velocity isotropy of short period body waves, and offers a reasonable physical interpretation for the scatterers detected at the top of the inner core. From rigorous multiple scattering modeling of seismic wave propagation through the aggregate, we obtain strong constraints on both the size and the elastic constants of iron patches. In a first step, we study the phase velocity and scattering attenuation of aggregates composed of hexagonal and cubic crystals, whose elastic constants have been published in the mineral physics literature. The predicted attenuations for P waves vary over two orders of magnitude. Our calculations demonstrate that scattering attenuation is extremely sensitive to the anisotropic properties of single crystals and offers an attractive way to discriminate among iron models with e.g. identical Voigt average speeds. When anisotropy of elastic patches is pronounced, we find that the S wavespeed in the aggregate can be as much as 15\% lower than the Voigt average shear velocity of a single crystal. In a second step, we perform a systematic search for iron models compatible with measured seismic velocities and attenuations. An iron model is characterized by its symmetry (cubic or hexagonal), elastic constants, and patch size. Independent of the crystal symmetry, we infer a most likely size of patch of the order of 400 m. Recent bcc iron models from the literature are in very good agreement with the most probable elastic constants of cubic crystals found in our inversion. Our study (1) suggests that the presence of melt may not be required to explain the low shear wavespeeds in the inner core and (2) supports the recent experimental results on the stability of cubic iron in the inner core, at least in its upper part.},

	abstract = {The Earth's magnetic field is sustained by dynamo action in the fluid outer core. The energy sources available to the geodynamo are well established, but their relative importance remains uncertain. We focus on the issue of thermal versus compositional convection, which is inextricably coupled to the evolution of the core as the Earth cools. To investigate the effect of the various physical processes on this evolution, we develop models based on conservation of energy and the assumption that the core is well mixed by vigorous convection. We depart from previous numerical studies by developing an analytical model. The simple algebraic form of the solution affords insight into both the evolution of the core and the energy budget of the geodynamo. We also present a numerical model to compare with the quantitative predictions of our analytical model and find that the differences between the two are negligible. An important conclusion of this study is that thermal convection can contribute significantly to the geodynamo. In fact, a modest heat flux in excess of that conducted down the adiabatic gradient is sufficient to power the geodynamo, even in the absence of compositional convection and latent-heat release. The relative contributions of thermal and compositional convection to the dynamo are largely determined by the magnitude of the heat flux from the core and the inner-core radius. For a plausible current-day heat flux of Q = 3.0 × 1012 W and the current inner-core radius, we find that compositional convection is responsible for approximately two thirds of the ohmic dissipation in the core and thermal convection for the remaining one third. The proportion of ohmic dissipation produced by thermal convection increases to 45\% with an increase in Q to 6.0 × 1012 W. In the early Earth, when the inner core was smaller and the heat flux probably greater than the present values, thermal convection would have been the dominant energy source for the dynamo. We also calculate the history of inner-core growth as a function of the heat flux. For example, the inner core would have grown to its present size in 2.8 × 109 years if the average heat flux was Q = 4.0 × 1012 W. The model does not require the heat flux to be constant.},

Here we determine directly the elastic and plastic deformation mechanism of iron at pressures of the Earth's core, from synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements of iron, under imposed axial stress, in diamond-anvil cells. The ε-iron (hexagonally close packed) crystals display strong preferred orientation, with c-axes parallel to the axis of the diamond-anvil cell. Polycrystal plasticity theory predicts an alignment of c-axes parallel to the compression direction as a result of basal slip, if basal slip is either the primary or a secondary slip system. The experiments provide direct observations of deformation mechanisms that occur in the Earth's inner core, and introduce a method for investigating, within the laboratory, the rheology of materials at extreme pressures.},

In the model it is assumed that traces of potassium are uniformly dispersed in the inner core and act as a heat source.

This result, extended to all path orientations, suggests a predominant effect of the anisotropy on travel times anomalies. A simultaneous inversion of absolute and differential core phase travel times for any path orientation favours a simple inner core model in which a large, homogeneous structure with 3\% uniform anisotropy is asymmetrically surrounded by a homogeneous isotropic layer with a thickness of 100–200 km on the western hemisphere, increasing to 400 km over a large part of the eastern hemisphere.},

The user is shielded from the complexities of interacting with different data centers and data exchange protocols and is provided with powerful diagnostic and plotting tools to check the retrieved data and metadata. While primarily a productivity tool for research seismologists and observatories, easy-to-use syntax and plotting functionality also make {obspyDMT} an effective teaching aid. Written in the Python programming language, it can be used as a stand-alone command-line tool (requiring no knowledge of Python) or can be integrated as a module with other Python codes. It facilitates data archiving, preprocessing, instrument correction and quality control – routine but nontrivial tasks that can consume much user time. We describe {obspyDMT}'s functionality, design and technical implementation, accompanied by an overview of its use cases. As an example of a typical problem encountered in seismogram preprocessing, we show how to check for inconsistencies in response files of two example stations. We also demonstrate the fully automated request, remote computation and retrieval of synthetic seismograms from the Synthetics Engine (Syngine) web service of the Data Management Center ({DMC}) at the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology ({IRIS}).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A better understanding of how the features present in a correlogram are generated can revolutionize the characterization of planetary interiors. Here, we investigated correlograms based on individual large earthquakes and identified 12 events from the past decade with a multitude of prominent and some ‘exotic’ features in the first 3 hr following correlation origin. We found that the type of the source mechanism and energy-release dynamics are the key influencers responsible for individual correlograms equal in quality to a stack of hundreds of correlograms. A single event is sufficient in creating a correlogram resembling previous correlograms constructed from a large number of events, which reinforces the notion that the earthquake coda-correlation features are not ‘reconstructed’ body waves. Numerical simulations of the correlation wavefield can thus be based on exceptional-quality events, becoming more computationally affordable. Here, we explain more than 60 features of the global coda-correlogram, which presents the most extensive catalogue to date.},

Hydrostatic equilibrium and stationary heat transfer are assumed, and the basic differential equations for the mechanical and thermal structure are solved numerically together with an isothermal Murnaghan-Birch type equation of state truncated in Eulerian strain at forth order. We obtain the radial distribution of mass, hydrostatic pressure, gravity, temperature, and heat flow density along with the corresponding density stratification, viscosity profiles, and the global seismic velocity structure of model Mars. The first model being consistent with the geochemical requirement produces C=0.357×Mprp2, whereas the second model commensurate with the geophysical constraint gives Fe/Si=1.35. The calculated central pressure is about 40 {GPa} in both models, and the central temperature is in the 2000 to 2200 K range. The model calculations suggest a Fe-Ni-{FeS} core a little less than one half of the planetary radius in size surrounded by a silicate mantle subdivided into lower spinel and upper olivine layers and overlain by a 100- to 250-km thick basaltic crust and a surface heatflow density of 25 to 30 {mW} m−2. In both models the pressure in the mantle is not sufficient for the spinel to perovskite transition to occur. The present thermal lithosphere is estimated to be about 500 km thick and to be subdivided into a 300-km-thick outermost rheological lithosphere and an underlying thermal boundary layer of mantle convection. Given the core sulfur content of 14 wt\% as derived from {SNC} meteorites, the Martian core is found to be entirely molten, implying the nonoperation of a self-sustained dynamo due to the absence of sufficiently vigorous convection.},

	abstract = {New empirical traveltime curves for the major seismic phases have been derived from the catalogues of the International Seismological Centre by relocating events by using P readings, depth phases and the iasp91 traveltimes, and then re-associating phase picks. A smoothed set of traveltime tables is extracted by a robust procedure which gives estimates of the variance of the traveltimes for each phase branch. This set of smoothed empirical times is then used to construct a range of radial velocity profiles, which are assessed against a number of different measures of the level of fit between the empirical times and the predictions of the models. These measures are constructed from weighted sums of L2 misfits for individual phases. The weights are chosen to provide a measure of the probable reliability of the picks for the different phases.A preferred model, ak135, is proposed which gives a significantly better fit to a broad range of phases than is provided by the iasp91 and sp6 models. The differences in velocity between ak135 and these models are generally quite small except at the boundary of the inner core, where reduced velocity gradients are needed to achieve satisfactory performance for {PKP} differential time data.The potential resolution of velocity structure has been assessed with the aid of a non-linear search procedure in which 5000 models have been generated in bounds about ak135. Misfit calculations are performed for each of the phases in the empirical traveltime sets, and the models are then sorted using different overall measures of misfit. The best 100 models for each criterion are displayed in a model density plot which indicates the consistency of the different models. The interaction of information from different phases can be analysed by comparing the different misfit measures. Structure in the mantle is well resolved except at the base, and ak135 provides a good representation of core velocities.},

Seismograms synthesized for the distance range 150° to 180° in models having a discontinuity at 300 km radius in the inner core exhibit focused diffractions around the innermost sphere at antipodal range that are inconsistent with observed {PKIKP} waveforms. A few examples, however, can be found of {PKIKP} complexity near 165°, consistent with a triplication created by a 475 km radius discontinuity. A rapid change in the magnitude and variance of seismic attenuation of {PKIKP} whose rays turn between 400 and 600 km radius is also observed, consistent with an innermost sphere of low, regionally uniform, seismic attenuation. Models predicting waveforms in agreement with observed waveforms have either a transition in elastic and anelastic properties spread over a depth interval greater than 100 km or an innermost sphere of differing elastic properties that exceeds 450 km radius. The weak but suggestive evidence for an innermost inner core may simply represent a transition in fabric, spread over 100 km or more, centered near 500 km radius. This change may signify the end stage of solidification, flow and re-crystallization, resulting in the highest ordering and largest grain sizes of intrinsically anisotropic crystals.},

	abstract = {The Earth's inner core, the slowly growing sphere of solid iron alloy at the centre of our planet, is known to exhibit seismic anisotropy. Both normal mode and body wave studies have established that, when the global average is taken, compressional waves propagate faster in the North–South direction than in the equatorial plane. Recent body wave studies also indicate that this fast direction may be more attenuating, and interpret this anisotropic attenuation in terms of anisotropic scattering due to inner core texturing. Here we use the Earth's normal modes to study the attenuation anisotropy of both compressional and shear waves in the inner core. As normal modes have wavelengths several orders of magnitude longer than estimates of inner core grain size, any attenuation anisotropy quantified using normal modes must reflect the anisotropy of intrinsic (viscoelastic) attenuation of the crystalline inner core alloy. By inverting zonal anelastic and elastic normal mode splitting function coefficients of twenty inner core sensitive modes, we construct models of inner core intrinsic attenuation and velocity anisotropy. We find that, for compressional waves, the North–South direction is both fast and more strongly attenuating. The existence of intrinsic inner core attenuation anisotropy can be interpreted in terms of anisotropic Zener relaxation in the metallic alloy comprising the inner core. Such anisotropic Zener relaxation has only been observed in the presence of solute atoms, and is thus entirely consistent with the presence of a few atomic per cent of light elements in the Earth's inner core.},

	abstract = {Progressive crystallization of Earth’s inner core drives convection in the outer core and magnetic field generation. Determining the rate and pattern of inner-core growth is thus crucial to understanding the evolution of the geodynamo. The growth history of the inner core is probably recorded in the distribution and strength of its seismic anisotropy, which arises from deformation texturing constrained by conditions at the inner-core solid–fluid boundary. Here we show from analysis of seismic body wave travel times that the strength of seismic anisotropy increases with depth within the inner core, and the strongest anisotropy is offset from Earth’s rotation axis. Then, using geodynamic growth models and mineral physics calculations, we simulate the development of inner-core anisotropy in a self-consistent manner. From this we find that an inner core composed of hexagonally close-packed iron–nickel alloy, deformed by a combination of preferential equatorial growth and slow translation, can match the seismic observations without requiring hemispheres with sharp boundaries. Our model of inner-core growth history is compatible with external constraints from outer-core dynamics, and supports arguments for a relatively young inner core ({\textasciitilde}0.5–1.5 Ga) and a viscosity {\textgreater}1018 Pa s.},

All observed modes are considered, but only the fundamentals plus 1S0 and 2S0 are used explicitly in the inversion. The method uses partial derivatives of period with respect to P velocity, S velocity, and density. Derivatives of period with respect to the size of the core affect the periods of low-order spheroidal modes by as much as 0.8 sec/km of change. The model is developed in two stages. First, geophysical arguments that are generally independent of inferences from free oscillations are used to develop an approximate earth model, {HT}11GS1. Secondly, inversion is used to derive from it a new model, {DI}-11, which fits the observed periods with an overall rms deviation of only 0.61 second. {DI}-11 is characterized by a rapid increase in density at depths 500 to 800km, an Adams-Williamson density below 1100km, a density jump of 2 g/cm3 at the base of the outer core, and a shear velocity of 2.18 km/sec in the inner core.

The arrival times on stacked seismograms require a shear-wave velocity at the top of the inner core β{ICB}=3.65 km/s in agreement with values suggested from normal mode observations. Julian et al.'s 1972 observation of a lower velocity (2.95 km/s) is easily reconciled with our result if interpreted as the surface reflection {pPKJKP}.

The compressional sound velocity {VP} at 50° and 90° from the c-axis was determined to be {VP}\{50°\}=9900±200 m/s and {VP}\{90°\}=9450±150 m/s, respectively. The difference of 4–5\% between the two velocities is of the same order of the seismic observations of the anisotropy in Earth's inner core. Combining our new results with the equation of state of hcp-iron, we derive the pressure dependence of the shear velocity {VS}. The {VS}-values, extrapolated to inner core densities, are 30\% higher than the {PREM} results. The extrapolated {VP}-values are instead in fair agreement with the {PREM} seismic model, though differences in the slope remain. Furthermore, assuming a strong texture characterized by cylindrical symmetry, we provide an estimate for the single crystal elastic modulus C11 as a function of pressure. While our results are in general agreement with the predominant existence of hcp-iron in Earth's inner core, the remaining differences might be assigned to the presence of another solid iron phase, light elements, or liquid inclusions as well as anharmonic high-temperature effects.},

Knowledge of the elasticity and texture of iron5,6 at core pressures is crucial for understanding the seismological observations, such as the low attenuation of seismic waves, thelow shear-wave velocity7,8 and the anisotropy of compressional-wave velocity9,10,11. The density and bulk modulus of hexagonal-close-packed iron have been previously measured to core pressures by static12 and dynamic13,14 methods. Here we study,using radial X-ray diffraction15 and ultrasonic techniques16, the shear modulus, single-crystal elasticity tensor, aggregate compressional- and shear-wave velocities, and orientation dependence of these velocities in iron. The inner core shear-wave velocity is lower than the aggregate shear-wave velocity of iron, suggesting the presence of low-velocity components or anelastic effects in the core. Observation of a strong lattice strain anisotropy in iron samples indicates a large (∼24\%) compressional-wave anisotropy under the isostress assumption, and therefore a perfect alignment of crystals6 would not be needed to explain the seismic observations. Alternatively the strain anisotropy may indicate stress variation due to preferred slip systems.},

Modeled {PKIIKP} waveforms are consistent with a near-zero shear modulus in the uppermost inner core in a 20–40 km thick patch beneath the eastern equatorial hemisphere. This bright spot of {PKIIKP} reflection correlates with a thin zone of low P velocity inferred from the complexity of {PKIKP} waveforms sampling this patch. Estimates of grain sizes from seismic attenuation, the absence of backscattered {PKiKP} coda in this region, and a prediction for enhanced heat flow through this patch suggest that it is a region of solidification rather than melting.},

The shear Q in the inner core is mostly constrained by new observations of {PKIKP} equivalent modes and is 110 ± 25 per cent. This is lower than in some previous models, which have used possibly erroneous observations of core modes, though the new models still predict too little attenuation to match the observations of strong differential attenuation of the {BC} and {DF} branches of {PKP} at frequencies of about 1 Hz. Agreement between the mode and body-wave data sets should probably not be expected since it now seems likely that the {PKIKP} data sense an absorption band which is distinct from that sensed by the mode data.The distribution of bulk attenuation in the Earth remains ill-constrained though bulk attenuation is required somewhere to explain the attenuation of the radial modes. Successful models tend to put significant bulk Q in the upper mantle.},

These high values directly demonstrate that the inner core is least dissipative within the Earth for long-period shear waves.

Because such inversions can severely underestimate the model uncertainties that are needed to guide mineralogical and dynamic interpretation, and because the quality of data has continued to improve, we revisit this seismic inverse problem using a model space search approach already proven effective with similar data. We do, indeed, observe model uncertainties at least an order of magnitude greater than earlier estimates. At the same time, we find that Q is determined well enough to confirm that the data favor several important features previously disputed because of questions of consistency. These include shear attenuation that drops significantly in the lower third of the lower mantle and bulk attenuation that is negligible in the inner core but stronger in the outer core and lower mantle than suggested by most models.},

	abstract = {The introduction of global, digitally recording, seismic networks has provided the seismological community with a large quantity of high quality data. At low frequencies the {IDA} (International Deployment of Accelerometers) network provides the best available data and, in this report, over 500 {IDA} records have been carefully analysed giving nearly 4000 reliable measurements of centre frequency and apparent attenuation of fundamental spheroidal modes. The attenuation rate of a normal mode of free oscillation of the Earth is measured in terms of its or quality factor and mean Q values for the modes 0S8- 0S46 are presented with standard deviations of 2-9\% . Mean centre frequencies have relative standard deviation of 5 x 10-5 to 5 x 10-4. The distribution of the centre frequencies reveals a large-scale aspherical structure in velocity and density but the distribution of the apparent attenuation measurements does not reveal a corresponding structure. A total of 26 new measurements of the mean Q of overtone modes with standard deviations of 5-30 \% have also been obtained by using single-record and multiple-record techniques. Combining the new data with reliable Q measurements from the literature gives a total of 71 data with which we can infer the radial structure of attenuation inside the Earth. This structure is not well constrained in detail and very simple models are capable of fitting the data. Experiments with synthetic data show that an improvement of an order of magnitude in both the number and quality of the measurements is required to make detailed inferences about the structure of attenuation. The data do constrain the average shear Q-1 in the inner core to be 1/3500 ( ± 60 \%) and the average shear Q-1 the mantle to be 1/250 ( ± 4 \%). These values are appropriate for frequencies less than 5 {mHz}. Comparison with published values at higher frequencies indicates there is a measurable frequency dependence of attenuation between 3 and 30 {mHz}. Very little can be inferred about bulk dissipation in the Earth beyond that it must exist to satisfy the attenuation of the radial modes. Experiments show that the data can be satisfied if bulk attenuation is an average 1.3\%, or more, of the shear attenuation. Constraining bulk attenuation to be no greater than 2 \% of the shear attenuation, and constraining the outer core to have no attenuation, forces bulk attenuation to be concentrated in the upper mantle.},

	abstract = {By the end of 2018, 42 years after the landing of the two Viking seismometers on Mars, {InSight} will deploy onto Mars’ surface the {SEIS} (Seismic Experiment for Internal Structure) instrument; a six-axes seismometer equipped with both a long-period three-axes Very Broad Band ({VBB}) instrument and a three-axes short-period ({SP}) instrument. These six sensors will cover a broad range of the seismic bandwidth, from 0.01 Hz to 50 Hz, with possible extension to longer periods. Data will be transmitted in the form of three continuous {VBB} components at 2 sample per second (sps), an estimation of the short period energy content from the {SP} at 1 sps and a continuous compound {VBB}/{SP} vertical axis at 10 sps. The continuous streams will be augmented by requested event data with sample rates from 20 to 100 sps. {SEIS} will improve upon the existing resolution of Viking’s Mars seismic monitoring by a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 2500\$at 1 Hz and \${\textbackslash}sim 200{\textbackslash},000\$at 0.1 Hz. An additional major improvement is that, contrary to Viking, the seismometers will be deployed via a robotic arm directly onto Mars’ surface and will be protected against temperature and wind by highly efficient thermal and wind shielding. Based on existing knowledge of Mars, it is reasonable to infer a moment magnitude detection threshold of \$M\_\{\{w\}\} {\textbackslash}sim 3\$at \$40{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$epicentral distance and a potential to detect several tens of quakes and about five impacts per year. In this paper, we first describe the science goals of the experiment and the rationale used to define its requirements. We then provide a detailed description of the hardware, from the sensors to the deployment system and associated performance, including transfer functions of the seismic sensors and temperature sensors. We conclude by describing the experiment ground segment, including data processing services, outreach and education networks and provide a description of the format to be used for future data distribution.},

Our analysis demonstrates that in non-hydrostatically compressed hcp metals the assumption of a single uniform macroscopic stress applied to all grains in the polycrystal for the inversion of the lattice strain equations is violated due to plastic deformation. In addition, the derived apparent moduli and elastic anisotropy differ significantly from those derived from single crystals. We propose that for cobalt, rhenium and iron, the elastic anisotropy in the meridian plane is best described by a sigmoidal shape for the longitudinal velocity, with the fastest direction along the c-axis. Based on these results, we suggest that preferential alignment of the c-axis of iron crystallites along the Earth's rotation axis is the most plausible explanation for the observed P-wave travel time anomalies in the inner core.},

	abstract = {A study is made of the free and forced oscillations of the earth. The natural periods are determined for radial, torsional and spheroidal types of oscillation. Several models of the earth are used: a homogeneous model, such as was assumed originally by Love, a model con­sisting of a homogeneous solid mantle enclosing a homogeneous liquid core, Bullen’s model B, and Bullard’s models I and {II}. It is found that the spheroidal oscillation of order 2 has a period of about 53·5 min in all models, except the homogeneous one, for which this period is only 44·3 min. The common period of 53·5 min agrees to within the observational error with the period of 57 min observed by Benioff on the seismograms of the Kamchatka earthquake of 1952. In contrast to all the other models, Bullen’s model B possesses an additional spheroidal oscillation of order 2 of a period of 101 min. The latter oscillation is confined mainly to the core, its amplitude in the mantle being relatively very small. Benioff’s observation of a second oscillation of a 100 min period in the Kamchatka earthquake record might be considered as evidence favouring Bullen’s model B. The latter differs from Bullard’s models mainly by having a central density of around 18 instead of about 12 g/cm3. However, a theoretical investigation of the relative excitation of the various free modes by an impulsive compressional point-source situated at a shallow focal depth, shows that the amplitude of the 100 min oscillation should be more than 1000 times weaker than that of the 53·5 min oscillation. It is thus not clear how a near-surface earthquake could have excited the core­-oscillation. The spectrum of the free modes of oscillation has also been determined for n = 3 and 4, including the fundamental and the first two overtones for each case. The computed free periods of spheroidal oscillation range from 53·5 min down to a period of 8 min for the fourth overtone in the case n = 2. We have also treated the bodily tides for Bullen’s and Bullard’s models. Love’s numbers were determined in the case n = 2 for tidal periods of 6, 6√2, 12 h and ∞. The dependence of the Love numbers on the period is small, a maximum range of variation of 13\% occurring in the k-values between the periods of 6 h and ∞.},

Curvature in the M discontinuity has the same effect on velocities υP(ϕ), but the azimuth dependence found by Hess in Raitt's and Shor's velocities, if real, is too large to be due to curvature. A sloping M discontinuity adds to velocities υP(ϕ) a term a cos ϕ + b sin ϕ. In a refraction survey of anisotropy, only two lines need be reversed to find a and b. If the ϕ dependence of velocities υP is due to a small mantle anisotropy and a small slope of the M discontinuity, velocities υP(ϕ) is determined for all ϕ by shooting five different lines through a point and reversing two of them or simply by shooting seven different lines.

	abstract = {The free oscillations of the earth have been experimentally verified from an analysis of strain seismograph and pendulum seismograph recordings made in California and Peru from the great Chilean earthquake of May 1960. Both spheroidal and torsional oscillations were revealed by a power spectral analysis of the seismograms. The gravest spheroidal mode shows a split spectral peak with periods of 54.7 and 53.1 minutes. The theoretical prediction for the Bullen B model according to Alterman, Perkeris, and Jarosch is 53.7 min. The oscillations were observed for all modes up to 38 with corresponding periods as short as 3.7 minutes. For the higher modes, agreement in the observed period is found between the Chilian earthquake and the Kamchatka earthquake of 1952. In almost all cases agreement between experimental and theoretical predictions is close. Differences which occur should make it possible to discriminate between the several earth models which have been proposed. From the width of the spectral peak, values of the dissipation function Q−1 for the earth could be determined with an accuracy greater than was previously possible. For the spheroidal mode S3(T = 35.5 min), Q = 380, and for the mode S18(T = 6.2 min), Q = 170. On the assumption that Q is independent of frequency, this implies a higher Q in the core than in the mantle. A method is described for deducing the fault length and rupture velocity from analysis of phase difference between components of ground motion. Preliminary results indicate a fault length for the Chilean earthquake of about 1000 km and rupture velocities in the range 3 to 4 km/sec.},

In order to incorporate such a change and maintain the representation of the full suite of seismic phases compensatory adjustments have to be made, dominantly in the mantle. Using multi-objective optimization, a new preferred radial model ek137 has been generated that provides a good representation of the traveltimes of all core phases. An adiabatic profile can be maintained through most of the outer core, but departures are needed at the base, as in the ak135 model. The latest estimates for inner core shear wave speed are included in ek137.},

We discuss frequency dependence of the quality factor Q in the Earth, 1D profiles and lateral variations in the crust and mantle, and the attenuation structure in the inner core. Much progress has been made recently in characterizing the lateral variations in attenuation in the crust and their relations to tectonics. Characterizing the nature and distribution of attenuation deeper in the Earth is still hampered by the need to separate elastic and anelastic effects on seismic-wave amplitudes. Nevertheless, consistent and robust features are emerging in recent tomographic studies of attenuation in the upper 200–300km of the mantle, which show that, in this depth range, lateral variations in attenuation are correlated with those in seismic velocities and with tectonics. This correlation fades out in the transition zone, where shear attenuation distribution bears more resemblance to velocity structure in the lowermost mantle. An unresolved issue is still a 20\% discrepancy between the measurements of fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves obtained using a propagating wave versus a normal mode approach. Regional studies of attenuation confirm the relation of Q with tectonics in the upper mantle and very strong lateral variations in subduction zone areas. In the inner core, recent studies have confirmed the increase of Q with depth and have found an intriguing hemispheric variation in Qα at the top of the inner core. Much of the attenuation in the inner core appears to be due to scattering.},

	abstract = {The Earth's core is composed of a fluid outer core, with a radius of 3480km, and a solid inner core, with a radius of about 1220km, which results from the freezing of the liquid core during the cooling of the Earth. Travel times, amplitudes, and waveforms of waves propagating through the core and normal modes having energy deep inside the Earth are the most powerful tools for investigating core structure. Important constraints are also provided by Earth dynamics, high-pressure physics, magnetic field analyses, and geochemical data. From seismic wave propagation, the liquid core appears homogeneous and nonstratified, except close to the inner core boundary ({ICB}) and perhaps close to the core–mantle boundary ({CMB}). The smooth P-velocity and density increase with depth reflects the pressure and temperature increase. The liquid core density, lower than the density of pure iron, indicates the presence of light elements in the liquid iron alloy, in an amount of about 10\%. The liquid core has a very high-quality factor (almost no wave attenuation). Its surface, the {CMB}, is a first-order discontinuity. Its topography is difficult to map because of the perturbing effect of the strong heterogeneities at the base of the mantle, but it may be small, {\textless}2–3km at long wavelengths ({\textasciitilde}1000km). Small topography ({\textasciitilde}100m) of kilometric wavelength responsible for wave scattering may also be present. The lowermost 150km at the base of the liquid core corresponds to a low P-velocity gradient, likely related to a density increase. This dense layer may possibly result from partial remelting of the frozen iron alloy in relation to inner core and outer core and outer core dynamics. The {ICB} appears as a first-order discontinuity. It corresponds to a small P-velocity and density increase with respect to the liquid core, which indicates an average depletion of the inner core in light elements, compared to the liquid core. No significant topography at the {ICB} could be safely detected to date, except perhaps at short wavelength from scattered waves. The rigidity of the inner core is well established from normal modes. Body-wave analyses favor an increase in S-velocities with depth, with low values at the {ICB}, possibly due to the presence of fluid inclusions in the solid iron alloy matrix. The seismic attenuation in the inner core is globally strong; the relative contributions of scattering and viscoelasticity are still debated. The inner core has a complex structure that is still debated and whose image evolves as new data become available. An important property of the inner core is its anisotropy, evidenced from both P-wave propagation and normal modes. P-wave velocity is 1–3\% higher in the direction parallel to the Earth's rotation axis than in the direction parallel to the equatorial plane. Oriented anisotropic iron crystals may explain this anisotropy, but the mechanism at the origin of crystal alignment is still debated. Depth variations in anisotropy are present: the top 100–150km is nearly isotropic, and the lowermost 300–600km (the innermost inner core) shows a different anisotropy, which is still to be specified. Some anisotropy in attenuation is also observed, with high attenuation in the direction of high velocity. The most intriguing feature of the inner core is the presence of a hemispherical pattern, observed both in the properties of the isotropic layer and in the degree of anisotropy below this layer: the uppermost 80km of the inner core has a higher mean velocity and a stronger attenuation in the eastern hemisphere than in the western hemisphere, defined with respect to the origin meridian. On the other hand, the western hemisphere is more anisotropic in both velocity and attenuation than the eastern hemisphere. This difference in apparent anisotropy may denote a variation in the degree of crystal alignment or a thicker isotropic layer beneath the eastern hemisphere. Wave scattering on iron grains with various sizes and orientations may explain both the observed variations in velocity and attenuation and their correlation, opposite to the one observed in the mantle. A possible faster rotation of the inner core with respect to the mantle is predicted by some geodynamo models, but thwarted by the gravimetric coupling with the mantle, which prevents a large steady rotation. Attempts to detect it rely on the analysis of a long series of seismic data sampling either specific paths or the whole Earth, from body waves or normal modes. The inferred rotation rates are very scattered, with most of the values below 0.2° year−1. A null rotation or small oscillations about the rotation axis are favored by the most recent results. Numerous open questions remain, concerning the structure at the core boundaries and the stratification at the base and top of the liquid core, the hemisphericity of the inner core, the structure of the innermost inner core, and the nature and texture of iron alloy. All these questions have strong implications on core dynamics and Earth differentiation. Future core exploration will, however, depend on the quality of Earth sampling by seismic data, thus on the deployment of observatories in poorly sampled continental areas and in oceans.},

Newly collected travel-time residuals from seismic waves from the {SSI} region that sample only Earth's mantle ({PcP} and P waves) have a comparable range to the {PKP} differential travel-time residuals, yet they are insensitive to core structure. This observation suggests that mantle structure affects {PKP} travel time residuals more than previously acknowledged and challenges the existing conceptual framework of a uniform inner core anisotropy. The inner core could be a conglomerate of anisotropic domains, and the {PKP} travel times are most likely influenced by the geometry of inner core sampling and inhomogeneous mantle structure. This concept reconciles observed complexities in travel times while preserving a net inner core anisotropy that is required by observations of Earth's free oscillations.},

Finally, we present a review of the models proposed to explain inner core rotation, inferred to exist from the secular changes in seismic velocity in the inner core, and inner core translation, suggested to explain simultaneously lateral variations in the inner core and a layer at the base of the outer core that shows a decrease in the P-wave velocity gradient.},

Using an effective medium theory for composite materials, we show that the presence of a volume fraction of 3 to 10\% liquid in the form of oblate spheroidal inclusions aligned in the equatorial plane between iron crystals is sufficient to explain the aforementioned seismic phenomena. Variation of S-wave velocity between the polar axis and equatorial plane is more sensitive to the addition of liquid than that of P waves. The liquid could arise from the presence of dendrites or a mixture of elements other than iron that exist in liquid form under inner-core conditions.},

Many variants of the geometrical configuration of stations have been used with the objective of maximizing potential resolution of the incoming wavefronts direction of arrival. A versatile class of array configurations, with good resolution properties, can be constructed with multiple spiral arms. The array response is comparable with the same number of full circles, but with far fewer stations and is robust to minor position changes in emplacement. The desirable properties of the spiral‐arm arrays are illustrated for a permanent array in the Precambrian Pilbara craton in northwestern Australia and for a temporary array on ancient sediments in southern Queensland, Australia. In each case, the practical array response is very good and matches the theoretical expectations. The spiral‐arm configuration allows the deployment of relatively large aperture arrays with a limited number of stations, which is advantageous in a broad range of seismic applications, including near‐surface characterization.Online Material: Figures illustrating the relation between spiral‐arm and multiring circular arrays.},

Clear inner core phases {PKIKP}2 and {PKIIKP}2 are observed across the entire array. Spatial analysis of the differential travel time residuals between the two phases reveals significant short-wavelength variation and implies the existence of strong structural variability in the deep Earth.

            Several seismic experiments were deployed on the Moon by the astronauts during the Apollo missions. The experiments began in 1969 with Apollo 11, and continued with Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Instruments at Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17 remained operational until the final transmission in 1977. These remarkable experiments provide a valuable resource. Now is a good time to review this resource, since the {InSight} mission is returning seismic data from Mars, and seismic missions to the Moon and Europa are in development from different space agencies. We present an overview of the seismic data available from four sets of experiments on the Moon: the Passive Seismic Experiments, the Active Seismic Experiments, the Lunar Seismic Profiling Experiment and the Lunar Surface Gravimeter. For each of these, we outline the instrumentation and the data availability.
            
              We show examples of the different types of moonquakes, which are: artificial impacts, meteoroid strikes, shallow quakes (less than 200 km depth) and deep quakes (around 900 km depth). Deep quakes often occur in tight spatial clusters, and their seismic signals can therefore be stacked to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. We provide stacked deep moonquake signals from three independent sources in {miniSEED} format. We provide an arrival-time catalog compiled from six independent sources, as well as estimates of event time and location where available. We show statistics on the consistency between arrival-time picks from different operators. Moonquakes have a characteristic shape, where the energy rises slowly to a maximum, followed by an even longer decay time. We include a table of the times of arrival of the maximum energy

            Finally, we outline minimum requirements for future lunar missions to the Moon. These requirements are particularly relevant to future missions which intend to share data with other agencies, and set out a path for an International Lunar Network, which can provide simultaneous multi-station observations on the Moon.},

We carry out a beamforming analysis of body waves at periods of 10 and 40 s recorded at {USArray} and show that the late coda, up to 10 h after the Okhotsk earthquake, is dominated by waves propagating in the great circle direction; late coda waves are not equipartitioned. This implies for seismic interferometry that teleseismic body waves can only be extracted from the coda when the earthquake and the receivers are located on a great circle. This happens automatically when the employed stations are antipodal or when the autocorrelation of waves is used. The use of long-period ambient seismic noise relies on the distribution of sources because scattering only marginally randomizes directions. This provides insight into recent observations of core phases extracted from seismic interferometry.},

Many compressional-wave anisotropy models have been proposed based on seismological observations. In contrast, inner-core shear-wave (J-wave) anisotropy—on a par with the compressional-wave anisotropy—has been elusive. Here, we present a new class of the J-wave anisotropy observations utilizing earthquake coda-correlation wavefield. We establish that the coda-correlation feature I2-J, sensitive to J-wave speed, exhibits time and amplitude changes when sampling the {IC} differently. J-waves traversing the {IC} near its center travel faster for the oblique than equatorial angles relative to the Earth's rotation axis by at least ∼5 s. The simplest explanation is the J-wave cylindrical anisotropy with a minimum strength of ∼0.8\%, formed through the lattice-preferred-orientation mechanism of iron. Although we cannot uniquely determine its stable iron phase, the new observations rule out one of the body-centered-cubic iron models.},

We show that, by stacking ambient-noise cross-correlations between {USArray} seismometers, body wave phases reflected off the outer core ({ScS}), and twice refracted through the inner core ({PKIKP}2) can be clearly extracted. Temporal correlation between the amplitude of these core phases and global seismicity suggests that the signals originate from distant earthquakes and emerge due to array interferometry. Similar results from a seismic array in New Zealand demonstrate that our approach is applicable in other regions and with fewer station pairs. Extraction of core phases by interferometry can significantly improve the spatial sampling of the deep Earth because the technique can be applied anywhere broadband seismic arrays exist.},

Based on temporal correlations with global seismicity, we show that the observed body waves are clearly earthquake related. Moreover, based on single-earthquake analysis, we show that the earthquake coda energy observed between 10,000 and 30,000 s after a large earthquake contributes the majority of the signal. We refine our method based on these observations and show that the signal can be significantly improved by selecting only earthquake coda times. With our improved processing, the {PKIKP} phase, which does not benefit from the focusing effect near the antipode, can now also clearly be observed for long-distance station pairs.},

	abstract = {Ambient noise tomography is a rapidly emerging field of seismological research. This paper presents the current status of ambient noise data processing as it has developed over the past several years and is intended to explain and justify this development through salient examples. The ambient noise data processing procedure divides into four principal phases: (1) single station data preparation, (2) cross-correlation and temporal stacking, (3) measurement of dispersion curves (performed with frequency—time analysis for both group and phase speeds) and (4) quality control, including error analysis and selection of the acceptable measurements. The procedures that are described herein have been designed not only to deliver reliable measurements, but to be flexible, applicable to a wide variety of observational settings, as well as being fully automated. For an automated data processing procedure, data quality control measures are particularly important to identify and reject bad measurements and compute quality assurance statistics for the accepted measurements. The principal metric on which to base a judgment of quality is stability, the robustness of the measurement to perturbations in the conditions under which it is obtained. Temporal repeatability, in particular, is a significant indicator of reliability and is elevated to a high position in our assessment, as we equate seasonal repeatability with measurement uncertainty. Proxy curves relating observed signal-to-noise ratios to average measurement uncertainties show promise to provide useful expected measurement error estimates in the absence of the long time-series needed for temporal subsetting.},

	abstract = {Seismic interferometry involves the crosscorrelation of responses at different receivers to obtain the Green’s function between these receivers. For the simple situation of an impulsive plane wave propagating along the [Formula: see text]-axis, the crosscorrelation of the responses at two receivers along the [Formula: see text]-axis gives the Green’s function of the direct wave between these receivers. When the source function of the plane wave is a transient (as in exploration seismology) or a noise signal (as in passive seismology), then the crosscorrelation gives the Green’s function, convolved with the autocorrelation of the source function. Direct-wave interferometry also holds for 2D and 3D situations, assuming the receivers are surrounded by a uniform distribution of sources. In this case, the main contributions to the retrieved direct wave between the receivers come from sources in Fresnel zones around stationary points. The main application of direct-wave interferometry is theretrieval of seismic surface-wave responses from ambient noise and the subsequent tomographic determination of the surface-wave velocity distribution of the subsurface. Seismic interferometry is not restricted to retrieving direct waves between receivers. In a classic paper, Claerbout shows that the autocorrelation of the transmission response of a layered medium gives the plane-wave reflection response of that medium. This is essentially 1D reflected-wave interferometry. Similarly, the crosscorrelation of the transmission responses, observed at two receivers, of an arbitrary inhomogeneous medium gives the 3D reflection response of that medium. One of the main applications of reflected-wave interferometry is retrieving the seismic reflection response from ambient noise and imaging of the reflectors in the subsurface. A common aspect of direct- and reflected-wave interferometry is that virtual sources are created at positions where there are only receivers without requiring knowledge of the subsurface medium parameters or of the positions of the actual sources.},

Year-long vertical-component time-series recorded between 2005 April 1 and 2006 March 31 have been correlated with one another to yield estimated fundamental mode Rayleigh wave Green’s functions. We ﬁlter these Green’s functions to compute Rayleigh wave group dispersion curves at periods of 5–50 s, using a phase-matched ﬁlter, frequency–time analysis technique. The uncertainties of the measurements are estimated based on the temporal variation of the dispersion curves revealed by 12 overlapping 3-month stacks. After selecting the highest quality dispersion curve measurements, we compute group velocity maps from 7 to 25 s period. These maps, and 1-D shear wave velocity models at four selected locations, exhibit clear correlations with major geological structures, including the Taranaki and Canterbury Basins, the Hikurangi accretionary prism, and previously reported basement terrane boundaries.},

These {EGFs} reveal velocity dispersion at relatively short periods, which can be used to resolve structures in the crust and uppermost mantle better than with traditional surface-wave tomography. We combine Rayleigh-wave dispersion estimates from {EGFs} and from traditional two-station ({TS}) analysis into a new approach to surface-wave array tomography with data from dense receiver arrays. We illustrate the methodology with continuous broad-band recordings from a temporary seismographic network on the southeastern part of the Tibetan plateau, in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, {SW} China. The {EGFs} are robust under temporal changes in regional seismicity and the use of either ambient noise (approximated by records without signal from events with magnitude mb ≥ 5 or 4) or surface wave coda produces similar results. The {EGFs} do not strongly depend on the presence of large earthquakes, but they are not reciprocal for stations aligned in the N–S direction. This directionality reﬂects the paucity of seismicity to the north of the array. Using a far-ﬁeld representation of the surface-wave Green’s function and an image transformation technique, we infer from the {EGFs} the Rayleigh-wave phase velocity dispersion in the period band from 10–30 s. A classical {TS} approach is used to determine Rayleigh-wave phase velocity dispersion between 20–120 s. Together, they constrain phase velocity variations for T = 10–120 s, which can be used to study the structure from the crust to the upper mantle. Beneath {SE} Tibet, short and intermediate period (10–80 s) phase velocities are prominently low, suggesting that the crust and upper mantle beneath {SE} Tibet is characterized by slow shear wave propagation.},

In a comparison between noise and earthquake data, we ﬁnd that the arrival times and the slowness of reﬂected waves, both sampling a region beneath Siberia, agree with those for a reﬂector at 2530 km depth, and the small amplitude reﬂections are sufﬁciently clear in the noise correlations to compare them reliably with synthetic data.

	abstract = {The existing reference Earth models have provided an excellent one-dimensional representation of Earth's properties as a function of its radius and explained many seismic observations in a broad frequency band. However, some discrepancies still exist among these models near the first-order discontinuities (e.g., the core-mantle and the inner-core boundaries) due to different data sets and approaches. As a new paradigm in global seismology, the analysis of coda-correlation wavefield is fundamentally different from interpreting direct observations of seismic phases or free oscillations of the Earth. The correlation features exist in global correlograms due to the similarity of body waves reverberating through the Earth's interior. As such, there is a great potential to utilize the information stored in the coda-correlation wavefield in constraining the Earth's internal structure. Here, we deploy the global earthquake-coda correlation wavefield as an independent data source in the 15–50 s period interval to increase the Earth's radial structure constraints. We assemble a data set of multiple pronounced correlation features and fit both their travel times and waveforms by computing synthetic correlograms through a series of candidate models. Misfit measurements for correlation features are then computed to search for the best-fitting model. The model that provides an optimal representation of the correlation features in the coda-correlation wavefield is {CCREM}. It displays differences in radial seismic velocities, especially near the first-order discontinuities, relative to previously proposed Earth-reference models. This is the first application of the earthquake-coda correlation wavefield in constraining the whole Earth's radial velocity structure.},

	abstract = {{AKI} (1969) ﬁrst modeled coda waves of a local earthquake as a superposition of scattered surface waves. This paper attempts to clarify the constituents of surface-wave coda at long periods at very long lapse times. For a large earthquake of magnitude 7 or larger, vertical component oscillation in periods from 90 to 180 s persists for more than 20 hours from the earthquake origin time. Although the early portion of the coda envelope is successfully modeled by assuming incoherent scattered Rayleigh waves by heterogeneities distributed all over the Earth, the later potion of the observed coda envelope (roughly later than 35,000 s) has systematically larger amplitude than theoretical prediction. To clarify the cause of this discrepancy, we studied the constituents of vertical-component seismograms of three large earthquakes recorded by the F-net in Japan using the f-k power spectral analysis. We found that the direct and scattered fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves of velocity about 3.7 km/s are dominant in the earlier part of each envelope. It justiﬁes the use of a scattering model of the fundamental Rayleigh waves for synthesizing the envelope. At lapse times later than 20,000 s–35,000 s, higher modes with phase velocities around 20 km/s become dominant. The transition time to the dominance of higher modes is found to become earlier for a deeper focus earthquake. The small coda attenuation factor from (1.90±0.23) · 10)3 to (2.38±0.32) · 10)3 estimated from later coda envelopes recorded at {IRIS} stations distributed worldwide also agrees with the attenuation factor of spheroidal modes according to {PREM}. We may interpret that higher mode waves are uniformly distributed at large lapse time due to large velocity dispersion and/or scattering and they dominate over the fundamental mode waves because of smaller attenuation in the lower mantle. The coda attenuation measurement proposed by Aki is found to be useful even for long periods and at very large lapse times.},

	abstract = {Body waves are routinely observed in cross-correlations of ambient noise records from seismic arrays worldwide but it is still poorly understood how the lack of uniform coverage of body wave sources at sea impacts reconstruction of some deep seismic phases such as, for example, reﬂections on mantle discontinuities. These difﬁculties presently hinder a generalization of the extraction of these phases, even though the feasibility of such techniques has been demonstrated previously. In this study, we focus on the extraction of P reﬂections from the 410 discontinuity (Pv410P) using cross-correlations from records of a quasi-linear array between Tibet and the Himalayas. We demonstrate that in this geographic location and with the network geometry at hand, the noise correlations in the second microseismic peak are during most of the year dominated by a noise source in the north Paciﬁc. The potential Pv410P phase revealed in the stacks of all data and through singular value decomposition analysis on a subset of data has an amplitude that is similar to that of cross terms of different body wave phases from the source area, so a positive identiﬁcation of the Pv410P remains speculative. As the arrival times and apparent velocity of mantle-reﬂected waves are close to those of several cross terms, other diagnostic tools are needed to identify areas and network conﬁgurations for which noise correlations can conﬁdently be used to analyse reﬂections from the mid-mantle discontinuities.},

This problem can be approached with seismic interferometry. In recent years, there has been considerable progress in the development of seismic interferometric techniques. The term seismic interferometry refers to the principle of generating new seismic responses by cross-correlating seismic observations at different receiver locations. The application of interferometric techniques on a global scale could create sources at locations where no earthquakes occur. In this way, yet unknown responses would become available for the application of travel-time tomography and surface-wave dispersion studies. The retrieval of a dense-enough sampling of source gathers would largely benefit the application of reflection imaging.},

	abstract = {In this work we investigate fundamentals of a method—referred to as full waveform ambient noise inversion—that improves the resolution of tomographic images by extracting waveform information from interstation correlation functions that cannot be used without knowing the distribution of noise sources. The fundamental idea is to drop the principle of Green function retrieval and to establish correlation functions as self-consistent observables in seismology. This involves the following steps: (1) We introduce an operator-based formulation of the forward problem of computing correlation functions. It is valid for arbitrary distributions of noise sources in both space and frequency, and for any type of medium, including 3-D elastic, heterogeneous and attenuating media. In addition, the formulation allows us to keep the derivations independent of time and frequency domain and it facilitates the application of adjoint techniques, which we use to derive efﬁcient expressions to compute ﬁrst and also second derivatives. The latter are essential for a resolution analysis that accounts for intraand interparameter trade-offs. (2) In a forward modelling study we investigate the effect of noise sources and structure on different observables. Traveltimes are hardly affected by heterogeneous noise source distributions. On the other hand, the amplitude asymmetry of correlations is at least to ﬁrst order insensitive to unmodelled Earth structure. Energy and waveform differences are sensitive to both structure and the distribution of noise sources. (3) We design and implement an appropriate inversion scheme, where the extraction of waveform information is successively increased. We demonstrate that full waveform ambient noise inversion has the potential to go beyond ambient noise tomography based on Green function retrieval and to reﬁne noise source location, which is essential for a better understanding of noise generation. Inherent trade-offs between source and structure are quantiﬁed using Hessian-vector products.},

	abstract = {Torfajökull volcano, Iceland, has not erupted since 1477. However, intense geothermal activity, deformation, and seismicity suggest a long-lasting magmatic system. In this paper, we use ambient noise tomography to image the magmatic system beneath Torfajökull volcano. One hundred days of ambient noise data from 23 broadband seismometers show the consistent presence of double-frequency microseism noise with significant power between ∼0.1 and 0.5 Hz. Beamforming results indicate microseism noise with persistent higher energy propagating from west and {SE} directions and apparent velocities below 3 km/s. We use ambient noise seismic interferometry to retrieve Rayleigh waves, and we introduce a method to estimate the reliability of the retrieved surface waves. We find stable estimation of surface wave phase velocities between 0.16 and 0.38 Hz. Azimuthal velocity variations show a trend of higher velocities in the {NE}/{SW} direction, the strike of the rift zone intersecting Torfajökull, and orientation of erupted lavas on a {NE}-{SW} fissure swarm. Tomographic results indicate low-velocity anomalies beneath the volcano caldera (between −5\% and −10\%) and even lower velocity variations in the southeast and southwest study area (below −10\%), outside the volcano caldera. Low anomalies may indicate the existence of hot material, more prominent outside the caldera outskirts. High-velocity variations (between 5\% and 10\%) outline the volcano caldera between 4- and 5-km depth and more pronounced velocities (between 10\% and 15\%) up to 5-km depth in the north of the volcano caldera. We interpret the former as possible caldera collapse structure and the latest as solidified intrusive magma from the old preferred magma paths.},

	abstract = {The Chia-Nan (Chiayi-Tainan) area is in the southwestern Taiwan, and is located at the active deformation front of the collision of the Eurasian continental plate and the Philippine Sea plate, which causes complex folds as well as thrust fault systems in the area. The Chukuo fault zone is a boundary between the Western Foothill and the Western Coastal Plain in the Chia-Nan area. The nature of the crustal structure beneath the fault zone, especially the eastern part of the fault zone with mountain topography, has not been well known in detailed due to lack of drilling data as well as its limitation in using other geophysical methods, such as active source survey. In this study, we deployed an array with 11 broadband seismic stations to monitor the seismicity of the Chukuo fault zone. The array has recorded more than 1000 microearthquakes around this area. It provides an opportunity to use P- and S-wave travel time data to investigate the both the crustal P- and S-velocity in the fault zone, however due to the nature of the earthquake distribution, the ray density is relatively low at depth between 0 and 7 km. In addition, the uncertainty of S-wave reading for small earthquake also a limit in building precise S-velocity proﬁle, Thus, we take the advantages of using cross-correlation of seismic ambient noise to investigate crustal S-velocity proﬁle in the Chukuo fault area, especially in the mountain area where crustal faulting is a dominated phenomenon. The results indicate that S-wave velocity in the uppermost crust in the Chukuo fault zone is shown to be slower than previous studies. A low velocity layer exists at depth between 1 and 2 km in the east of the Chukuo Fault. The low S-velocity is related to a highly fractured upper crust due to intensive deformation caused by the orogenic process.},

The phase velocities were obtained from a combination of ambient noise and teleseismic surface wave tomography, and then the phase velocities were inverted to S-wave velocities. The results show that both the Huabei Basin and Ordos Block have markedly rapid variations in both crustal velocities and the Moho depth. Huabei Basin has a thin (31–34 km) crust with low velocities while Ordos Block has a thick ( 40 km) crust with high velocities. We also estimated the lithospheric thickness from the inverted S-wave velocities using a simple S-wave velocity/temperature relationship. Huabei Basin was imaged as a low S-wave-velocity anomaly in the uppermost mantle with very thin lithosphere ( 65 km), while Ordos Block was revealed as a high S-wave-velocity anomaly with rather thick lithosphere ({\textgreater}120 km). These results indicated that Huabei Basin and Ordos Block have different thermal and/or chemical properties and had experienced different mantle processes and evolution histories since the Cenozoic. Furthermore, slow S-wave velocities and very thin lithosphere ( 65 km) were also found beneath Hetao and Weihe rifts bounding Ordos Block at north and south, respectively. However, Shanxi Rift—the boundary between Huabei Basin and Ordos Block—had a much thicker and higher velocity lithosphere than Hetao and Weihe rifts.},

Data from a {PASSCAL} experiment operated within the Coso geothermal field between 1998 and 2000 and surrounding broadband stations from the Southern California Seismic Network are acquired and processed. Daily cross correlations of ambient noise between all pairs of stations that overlapped in time of deployment were calculated and then stacked over the duration of deployment. Phase velocities of Rayleigh waves between 3 and 10 s periods are measured from the resulting cross correlations. Depending on the period, between about 300 and 600 reliable phase velocity measurements are inverted for phase velocity maps from 3 to 10 s periods, which in turn are inverted for a 3-D shear velocity model beneath the region. The resulting 3-D model reveals features throughout the region that correlate with surface geology. Beneath the Coso geothermal area shear velocities are generally depressed, a prominent low-velocity anomaly is resolved clearly within the top 2 km, no significant anomaly is seen below about 14 km depth, and a weakly resolved anomaly is observed between 6 and 12 km depth. The anomaly in the top 2 km probably results from geothermal alteration in the shallow subsurface, no magmatic body is imaged beneath 14 km depth, but the shear velocity anomaly between 6 and 12 km may be attributable to partial melt. The thickness and amplitude of the magma body trade off in the inversion and are ill determined. Low velocities in the regions surrounding Coso at depths near 7 km underlie areas with Miocene to recent volcanism, suggesting that some magmatic processing of the crust could be focused near this depth.},

Data resources include the permanent Federation of Digital Seismographic Networks, five temporary U.S. Program for Array Seismic Studies of the Continental Lithosphere ({PASSCAL}) experiments in and around Tibet, and Chinese provincial networks surrounding Tibet from 2003 to 2009, totaling ∼600 stations and ∼150,000 interstation paths. With such a heterogeneous data set, data quality control is of utmost importance. We apply conservative data quality control criteria to accept between ∼5000 and ∼45,000 measurements as a function of period, which produce a lateral resolution between 100 and 200 km across most of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions to the east. Misfits to the accepted measurements among {PASSCAL} stations and among Chinese stations are similar, with a standard deviation of ∼1.7 s, which indicates that the final dispersion measurements from Chinese and {PASSCAL} stations are of similar quality. Phase velocities across the Tibetan Plateau are lower, on average, than those in the surrounding nonbasin regions. Phase velocities in northern Tibet are lower than those in southern Tibet, perhaps implying different spatial and temporal variations in the way the high elevations of the plateau are created and maintained. At short periods ({\textless}20 s), very low phase velocities are imaged in the major basins, including the Tarim, Qaidam, Junggar, and Sichuan basins, and in the Ordos Block. At intermediate and long periods ({\textgreater}20 s), very high velocities are imaged in the Tarim Basin, the Ordos Block, and the Sichuan Basin.

The signal-to-noise ratios ({SNR}) of Rayleigh waves for positive and negative correlation time lags at periods of 8, 14, 25 and 50 s are used to determine the azimuthal distribution of strong ambient noise sources. Ambient noise in both the primary (10–20 s) and secondary microseism bands (5–10 s) comes dominantly from the directions of relatively nearby coastlines with stronger noise occurring in the Northern Hemisphere in northern winter and in the Southern Hemisphere in southern winter, consistent with the hypothesis that oceanic microseisms are generating this noise. The observed differences in the directivity of noise in the primary and secondary microseism bands are the consequence of propagation and attenuation, rather than the location of generation. At intermediate and long periods ({\textgreater}20 s), there is much less seasonal variation in both signal strength and directivity. We argue that our results are explained most simply by near-coastal sources rather than deep ocean sources at all periods. Although the dominant ambient noise sources are distributed inhomogeneously in azimuth, strong ambient noise emerges from most directions when using recordings that are 1 year in duration. Simulations illustrate that this is what ensures the accuracy of the empirical Green's functions and ambient noise tomography.},

At night, Mars is extremely quiet; seismic noise is about 500 times lower than Earth’s microseismic noise at periods between 4 s and 30 s. The recorded seismic noise increases during the day due to ground deformations induced by convective atmospheric vortices and ground-transferred wind-generated lander noise. Here we constrain properties of the crust beneath {InSight}, using signals from atmospheric vortices and from the hammering of {InSight}’s Heat Flow and Physical Properties ({HP}3) instrument, as well as the three largest Marsquakes detected as of September 2019. From receiver function analysis, we infer that the uppermost 8–11 km of the crust is highly altered and/or fractured. We measure the crustal diffusivity and intrinsic attenuation using multiscattering analysis and find that seismic attenuation is about three times larger than on the Moon, which suggests that the crust contains small amounts of volatiles.},

We determine a new seismic model of the Moon after a complete independent reprocessing of the Apollo lunar seismic data with determination of arrival times of about 60 natural and artificial lunar quakes, as well as travel times of converted phases at the crust–mantle interface below the Apollo 12 landing site. On the near side in the Procellarum {KREEP} Terrane, the only major discontinuity compatible with the crust–mantle boundary is located around 30 km deep. In this terrane, seismic constraints on the crust and mantle lead to a 30 km thick anorthositic crust and a pyroxenite cold mantle, with a bulk composition of 6.4\% Al2O3, 4.9\% {CaO} and 13.3\% {FeO}. Mantle temperatures are in accordance with profiles obtained from the observed electrical conductivity and exclude a liquid Fe core, while being compatible with a Fe–S liquid core. Our Moon model might be explained by a mixture of a primitive Earth with tholeiitic crust and depleted upper mantle, together with a chondritic enstatitic parent body for the impactor planet. It provides mixture coefficients comparable to those obtained by impact simulation as well as an estimate of bulk U of about 28 ppb, in accordance with the U budget in a 40 km mean thick crust, 700 km thick depleted mantle and a lower undepleted primitive mantle.},

	abstract = {{AbstractWe} retrieve P diving waves by applying seismic interferometry to ambient-noise records observed at Long Beach, California, and invert travel times of these waves to estimate 3-D P wave velocity structure. The ambient noise is recorded by a 2-D dense and large network, which has about 2500 receivers with 100 m spacing. Compared to surface wave extraction, body wave extraction is a much greater challenge because ambient noise is typically dominated by surface wave energy. For each individual receiver pair, the cross-correlation function obtained from ambient-noise data does not show clear body waves. Although we can reconstruct body waves when we stack correlation functions over all receiver pairs, we need to extract body waves at each receiver pair separately for imaging spatial heterogeneity of subsurface structure. Therefore, we employ two filters after correlation to seek body waves between individual receiver pairs. The first filter is a selection filter based on the similarity between each correlation function and the stacked function. After selecting traces containing stronger body waves, we retain about two million correlation functions (35\% of all correlation functions) and successfully preserve most of body wave energy in the retained traces. The second filter is a noise suppression filter to enhance coherent energy (body waves here) and suppress incoherent noise in each trace. After applying these filters, we can reconstruct clear body waves from each virtual source. As an application of using extracted body waves, we estimate 3-D P wave velocities from these waves with travel time tomography. This study is the first body wave tomography result obtained from only ambient noise recorded at the ground surface. The velocity structure estimated from body waves has higher resolution than estimated from surface waves.},

	abstract = {Seismic interferometry is widely applied to retrieve wavefields propagating between receivers. Another version of seismic interferometry, called inter-source interferometry, uses the principles of seismic reciprocity and expands interferometric applications to retrieve waves that propagate between two seismic sources. Previous studies of inter-source interferometry usually involve surface-wave and coda-wave estimations. We use inter-source interferometry to estimate the P-waves propagating between two sources rather than the estimation of surface waves and coda waves. We show that the recovered arrival times are dependent on the accuracy of the earthquake catalog of the two sources. Using inter-source interferometry, one can recover the waveform of the direct body waves and potentially reconstruct the waveform of coda waves, depending on the source-receiver geometry. The retrieval of these waveforms is accurate only when the wavefield is sampled with approximately 4 receivers per wavelength in the stationary phase zone. We show that using only receivers inside the stationary phase region for inter-source interferometry introduces the phase error of approximately 0.3 radians. In our study, we show an example of the P-wavefield reconstruction between two earthquakes using the seismic records from an array along San Andreas Fault. The retrieved P waves give a qualitative estimation of the thickness of the low-velocity zone of San Andreas Fault of approximately 4 km.},

To extract reliable inter-event {EGFs} and obtain stable tomographic results, we used about 1300 event pairs with good signal-to-noise ratio, each pair well aligned to a seismic station. Our results show that the retrieved inter-event {EGFs} agree well with those obtained from earthquakes in similar paths. The inverted velocity model presents two main layers including upper crust (up to {\textasciitilde}16 km) and middle crust (deeper than {\textasciitilde}18 km) in both sides of the Minab-Zendan-Palami transition zone. The upper crust contains two main layers: sedimentary and basement layers with thicknesses {\textasciitilde}6 and {\textasciitilde}10 km, respectively. Moreover, the main faults cause lateral variations in these main layers. The difference between the average velocities of the middle crust, between the collision and subduction zones, is about 0.5 km/s, delimited by faults. Also, an area with a 30 km width along these faults can be defined as the collision-subduction transition zone.},

With the help of a high-quality earthquake catalog, I was able to determine the shear wave velocity in the region of the five clusters separately. The shear wave velocities range between 3.5 and 4.2 km/s. The resolution of this novel method is given by the extent of the clusters and better than for a comparable classical tomography. It is suggested to use the method in a tomographic inversion and map the shear wave velocity in the source region with unprecedented resolution. Furthermore, the influence of focal mechanisms and the attenuation properties on the polarity and location of the maxima in the cross-correlation functions is discussed.

Our primary focus is to obtain an accurate time-image of the subducting interface. We propose a novel two-step kinematically correct redatuming procedure that first redatums the data from earthquakes below the subducting interface to the surface via classical interferometry, and then utilizes source-receiver wavefield interferometry to redatum virtual surface seismic data to the location of a particular earthquake event.},

	abstract = {In the field of seismic interferometry, researchers have retrieved surface waves and body waves by cross-correlating recordings of uncorrelated noise sources to extract useful subsurface information. The retrieved wavefields in most applications are between receivers. When the positions of the noise sources are known, inter-source interferometry can be applied to retrieve the wavefields between sources, thus turning sources into virtual receivers. Previous applications of this form of interferometry assume impulsive point sources or transient sources with similar signatures. We investigate the requirements of applying inter-source seismic interferometry using nontransient noise sources with known positions to retrieve reflection responses at those positions and show the results using synthetic drilling noise as source. We show that, if pilot signals (estimates of the drill-bit signals) are not available, it is required that the drill-bit signals are the same and that the phases of the virtual reflections at drillbit positions can be retrieved by deconvolution interferometry or by cross-coherence interferometry. Further, for this case, classic interferometry by cross-correlation can be used if the source power spectrum can be estimated. If pilot signals are available, virtual reflection responses can be obtained by first using standard seismic-whiledrilling processing techniques such as pilot cross-correlation and pilot deconvolution to remove the drill-bit signatures in the data and then applying cross-correlation interferometry. Therefore, provided that pilot signals are reliable, drill-bit data can be redatumed from surface to borehole depths using this inter-source interferometry approach without any velocity information of the medium, and we show that a well-positioned image below the borehole can be obtained using interferometrically redatumed reflection responses with just a simple velocity model. We discuss some of the practical hurdles that restrict the application of the proposed method offshore.},

As an illustration, seismograms from two earthquakes are constructed on a seismometer deployed only after the earthquakes’ seismic energy had completely dissipated. Bizarrely, a contributory component of such deterministic seismograms turns out to be ambient, random seismic noise. The seismograms obtained can be used to estimate seismic velocities in the vicinity of the seismometer, and provide independent information about the source phase (which is unavailable from the equivalent direct recordings).

One application of redatuming is to reduce the distorting effects of overburden structures for better imaging of subsurface structures at depth. Classic seismic interferometry allows for the reconstruction of the Green’s function between two receivers in the subsurface but needs illumination along the surrounding boundary. In contrast, Marchenko redatuming only requires one‐sided illumination; however, a smooth estimate of the velocity model is needed to convert the focusing times to depth. We test interferometric and Marchenko redatuming approaches using synthetic data in a 1D medium for the estimation of a virtual source beneath a heterogeneous layer. For Marchenko redatuming, upgoing and downgoing components of the virtual Green’s function can be estimated, and from the deconvolution of these at a series of depths, an inversion for subsurface reflectivity can be obtained. Extended source–receiver Marchenko redatuming allows for the reconstruction of the Green’s function at depth where there are no physical sources or receivers in the subsurface. Extended source–receiver Marchenko redatuming can also be utilized to reconstruct the wavefield from a virtual source along an arbitrarily sampled virtual array of receivers in the subsurface. Marchenko redatuming, using one‐sided illumination, may prove useful for the estimation of shallow Earth structure and also by reciprocity for deeper structure, using earthquake sources.},

	title = {Source-receiver wavefield interferometry in scattering media},
	abstract = {Seismic or wavefield interferometry refers to a set of methods that synthesize wavefields between pairs of receivers, pairs of sources, or a source and a receiver, using wavefields propagating from and to surrounding boundaries of sources and/or receivers. Starting from cross-correlations of ambient seismic noise recordings, which provide the signal between two receivers as if one of them had been an active source, interferometric methods developed rapidly within the last decade, revolutionizing the way in which seismic, acoustic, elastic, or electromagnetic waves are used to image and monitor the interior of a medium. Only recently, an explicit link was found between the methods of source-receiver interferometry ({SRI}) and seismic imaging, a technique widely used in seismic exploration to map diffractors and reflectors in the subsurface, but also in more academic studies investigating, for example, deep crustal processes. This link is particularly interesting because {SRI}, in contrast to classical imaging schemes, does not rely on the single-scattering assumption but accounts for all multiple-scattering effects in the medium. While first non-linear imaging schemes based on {SRI} have been proposed, the full potential of the method remains to be explored and a number of open questions concerning, for example, the role of non-physical energy in interferometric wavefield estimates, require further investigation. The aim of this thesis is to gain more insight into the method of source-receiver interferometry in the context of wavefield construction and analysis in multiply scattering media, especially when theoretical requirements of the method (such as complete boundaries of sources and receivers, surrounding the medium of interest) are not met. First I analyse the single diffractor case using partial surface boundaries only. I find that only two out of eight terms of the {SRI} equation are required to construct a robust estimate of the scattered wavefield, and that one of these two terms is also used in seismic imaging. The other term provides a pseudo-physical estimate of the scattered wave; this is a new type of non-physical energy that emulates the kinematics of a physically scattered wave. I then proceed to a multiple scattering scenario, using the pseudo-physical term to predict the travel times and exact scattering paths of multiply diffracted waves. The presented algorithm is purely data-driven and fully automated and, as a by-product, provides a new tool to isolate primary diffracted waves from a complex multiply diffracted wavefield. Finally, the concept is expanded to multiply reflecting media. In reflection seismic data, multiply reflected waves should be removed prior to migration in order to avoid artefacts in the seismic image. I demonstrate how internal multiples can be estimated and attenuated using pseudo-physical energy constructed from {SRI}. Moreover, an explicit link is derived between the internal-multiple equation based on {SRI} and the internal-multiple equation derived from the inverse-scattering series ({ISS}), currently the most capable algorithm for internal-multiple attenuation. Using the insight provided by the {SRI} approach, I suggest an alternative equation that estimates internal multiples more effciently compared to the current method. Overall, this thesis improves our understanding of how physical, non-physical, and pseudo-physical wavefields are constructed in {SRI}, how new information about multiply scattered wavefields can be inferred, and how {SRI} relates to other methods of wavefield analysis, in particular seismic imaging and the {ISS}.},

	abstract = {Natural seismic events have been detected by the long-period seismometers at Apollo stations 16, 14, 15, and 12 at annual rates of 3300, 1700, 800, and 700, respectively, with peak activity at 13- to 14-day intervals. Repetitive moonquakes from 41 hypocenters produce seismograms characteristic of each. About 90\% of the long-period signals are from these and other numerous, less active hypocenters, and meteoroid impact signals account for the remainder. At each hypocenter, moonquakes occur only within an active period of a few days during a characteristic phase of the monthly lunar tidal cycle. An episode of activity may contain up to four quakes from one hypocenter. Nearly equal numbers of hypocenters are active at opposite phases of the monthly cycle, accounting for the 14-day peaks in total lunar seismic activity. A period of about 206 days in the seismic activity of several of the hypocenters is superimposed on a strong one-to two-year trend where the signal amplitudes decrease to the instrumental detection threshold. A 206-day period with no secular decrease in amplitude is also observed in the total lunar seismic activity, suggesting that the total number of active hypocenters does not vary appreciably with time. Moonquake magnitudes range between 0.5 and 1.3 on the Richter scale with a total energy release estimated to be about 1011 ergs annually. With several possible exceptions, the moonquake foci located to date occur in two narrow belts on the near side of the moon. Both belts are 100–300 km wide, about 2000 km long, and 800–1000 km deep, and they lie along great-circle arcs. Seismic data from a far-side focus and a large far-side meteoroid impact define the base of the lunar lithosphere at a depth of about 1000 km. In our present model the rigid lithosphere overlies an asthenosphere of reduced rigidity in which present-day partial melting is probable. Tidal deformation presumably leads to critical stress concentrations at the base of the lithosphere, where moonquakes are found to occur. The striking tidal periodicities in the pattern of moonquake occurrence and energy release suggest that tidal energy is the dominant source of energy released as moonquakes. Thus, tidal energy is dissipated by moonquakes in the lithosphere and probably by inelastic processes in the asthenosphere. The low level of seismicity and the absence of shallow seismicity implies that the moon is neither expanding nor contracting at an appreciable rate. The secular accumulation of strain implied by the uniform polarities of moonquake signals may result from weak convection in the asthenosphere or from secular recession of the moon from the earth.},

	abstract = {The data from the International Seismological Centre bulletins for the years 1964–1979 are used to derive a three-dimensional model of lateral variations of the P velocity in the lower mantle. Unlike previous studies, in which such perturbations were represented by a blocklike parameterization, we seek the solution in the form δυ(r, θ, ϕ) = Σk = 0K Σl = 0L Σm = 0l ƒk(r)({kAlm} cos mϕ + {kBlm} sin mϕ) plm (cos θ). Some 500,000 travel time residuals for teleseismic distances from 5000 earthquakes are used in an iterative procedure to derive the coefficients A and B, the maximum K and L used are 4 and 6, respectively. In each iteration, in addition to solving for the three-dimensional structure, we also relocate all the earthquakes, perturb the average travel time curve, and determine station corrections for over 1000 stations. Particular attention is given to the problem of weighting the individual observations in order to avoid, as much as possible, the bias due to the uneven distribution of sources and receivers. The resulting model shows a high level of perturbations just below the 670-km discontinuity and just above the core-mantle boundary, where the maximum perturbations reach 1–1.5\% of the average velocity even for this highly smoothed model. At a depth of 2000 km the rms perturbations are some 3 to 4 times lower than at either of the two boundaries. The model predicts well the large-scale pattern of observed travel time residuals for various source regions except for the distinct effects of the subduction zones. The most striking large-scale three-dimensional feature of the model is a ring of high velocities circumscribing the Pacific basin within a depth range from 1000 km to the core-mantle boundary. If the proportionality between perturbations in the velocity and temperature is assumed, the derived pattern of anomalies could be consistent with a two boundary layer model of convection in the lower mantle. Some caution, however, should be exercised in interpreting the results near the 670-km discontinuity, where the resolving power of our data set is limited by the lack of adequate control of the upper mantle structure. At the same time, a significant global increase in the level of perturbations in the lowermost mantle is established beyond question. The results of Dziewonski et al. (1977) on the correlation between the “equivalent geoid” and the observed geoid for the angular order numbers 2 and 3 is confirmed, but there is no significant correlation for degrees from 4 to 6. These calculations are made for the rigid earth. Richards and Hager (this issue) show that introduction of finite viscosity can change the sign of a geoid anomaly. In addition, recent studies of lateral variations in the shear velocity reveal the presence of large-scale anomalies in the upper mantle. Thus, while the inferences made here with respect to the origin of the gravest orders of the geopotential field are not conclusive, they point the way in which results from seismology can be used to address some of the basic questions of geodynamics.},

	abstract = {Compared to the mantles of the Moon and perhaps Mars, the Earth's mantle is much less differentiated chemically. Both the Moon and Mars appear to have undergone a major differentiation accompanying planet formation. The only clear signature of a similar event on the Earth is core formation. While this might imply that the Earth did not experience extensive melting and differentiation during planet formation, the higher pressures and temperatures present in the Earth could have led to a distinctly different chemical evolution for this initial differentiation. The most significant potential outcome of early differentiation on the Earth's mantle is formation of chemically distinct upper and lower mantles distinguished by Mg/Si higher and lower than chondritic, respectively. Plate tectonics on Earth provides a continuing mechanism for planet differentiation that forms crust at the expense of chemical differentiation of the mantle. Plate tectonics, however, also offers a mechanism to return the chemically distinct materials of the crust back into the mantle. Mixing of subducted crustal material into the mantle through the stirring provided by mantle convection can serve to negate the effects of crust formation on the chemical composition of the mantle. Similarly, mixing within the mantle could serve to destroy evidence of early differentiation, if such differentiation occurred on Earth. Completely efficient operation of the plate tectonic cycle would result in remixing of crust and differentiated mantle, with the end result being a homogenous mantle with composition identical to that of the bulk earth minus the materials segregated into the core. In part, this may explain the relatively undifferentiated nature of the Earth's mantle. Plate tectonics has not been completely efficient on Earth, however. Both oceanic and continental crust exist, and there is widespread evidence for chemical variability in the mantle. At least four chemically and isotopically distinct components are observed in mantle-derived rocks. The nature of these components points to the importance of crust formation and recycling in determining the chemical variability of the mantle. Mapping of the surface expression of chemical heterogeneity in the mantle is providing new views of the chemical structure of the mantle and the geodynamic processes that operate in the Earth's interior.},

	abstract = {The birth and infancy of Earth was a time of profound differentiation involving massive internal reorganization into core, mantle and proto-crust, all within a few hundred million years of solar system formation (t0). Physical and isotopic evidence indicate that the formation of iron-rich cores generally occurred very early in planetesimals, the building blocks of proto-Earth, within about 3 million years of t0. The final stages of terrestrial planetary accretion involved violent and tremendously energetic giant impacts among core-segregated Mercury- to Mars-sized objects and planetary embryos. As a consequence of impact heating, the early Earth was at times partially or wholly molten, increasing the likelihood for high-pressure and high-temperature equilibration among core- and mantle-forming materials. The Earth's silicate mantle harmoniously possesses abundance levels of the siderophile elements Ni and Co that can be reconciled by equilibration between iron alloy and silicate at conditions comparable to those expected for a deep magma ocean. Solidification of a deep magma ocean possibly involved crystal–melt segregation at high pressures, but subsequent convective stirring of the mantle could have largely erased nascent layering. However, primitive upper mantle rocks apparently have some nonchondritic major and trace element refractory lithophile element ratios that can be plausibly linked to early mantle differentiation of ultra-high-pressure mantle phases. The geochemical effects of crystal fractionation in a deep magma ocean are partly constrained by high-pressure experimentation. Comparison between compositional models for the primitive convecting mantle and bulk silicate Earth generally allows, and possibly favors, 10–15\% total fractionation of a deep mantle assemblage comprised predominantly of Mg-perovskite and with minor but geochemically important amounts of Ca-perovskite and ferropericlase. Long-term isolation of such a crystal pile is generally consistent with isotopic constraints for time-integrated Sm/Nd and Lu/Hf ratios in the modern upper mantle and might account for the characteristics of some mantle isotope reservoirs. Although much remains to be learned about the earliest formative period in the Earth's development, a convergence of theoretical, physical, isotopic and geochemical arguments is beginning to yield a self-consistent portrait of the infant Earth.},

I. Introductory.
Of all regions of the earth none invites speculation more than that which lies beneath our feet, and in none is speculation more dangerous; yet, apart from speculation, it is little that we can say regarding the constitution of the interior of the earth. We know, with sufficient accuracy for most purposes, its size and shape: we know that its mean density is about 5 1/2 times that of water, that the density must increase towards the centre, and that the temperature must be high, but beyond these facts little can be said to be known. Many theories of the earth have been propounded at different times: the central substance of the earth has been supposed to be fiery, fluid, solid, and gaseous in turn, till geologists have turned in despair from the subject, and become inclined to confine their attention to the outermost crust of the earth, leaving its centre as a playground for mathematicians.
The object of this paper is not to introduce another speculation, but to point out that the subject is, at least partly, removed from the realm of speculation into that of knowledge by the instrument of research which the modern seismograph has placed in our hands. Just as the spectroscope opened up a new astronomy by enabling the astronomer to determine some of the constituents of which distant stars are composed, so the seismograph, recording the unfelt motion of distant earthquakes, enables us to see into the earth and},

	abstract = {We present the results of Rayleigh wave and Love wave phase velocity tomography in the western United States using ambient seismic noise observed at over 250 broad-band stations from the {EarthScope}/{USArray} Transportable Array and regional networks. All available three-component time-series for the 12-month span between 2005 November 1 and 2006 October 31 have been cross-correlated to yield estimated empirical Rayleigh and Love wave Green's functions. The Love wave signals were observed with higher average signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) than Rayleigh wave signals and hence cannot be fully explained by the scattering of Rayleigh waves. Phase velocity dispersion curves for both Rayleigh and Love waves between 5 and 40 speriod were measured for each interstation path by applying frequency—time analysis. The average uncertainty and systematic bias of the measurements are estimated using a method based on analysing thousands of nearly linearly aligned station-triplets. We find that empirical Green's functions can be estimated accurately from the negative time derivative of the symmetric component ambient noise cross-correlation without explicit knowledge of the source distribution. The average traveltime uncertainty is less than 1 s at periods shorter than 24 s. We present Rayleigh and Love wave phase speed maps at periods of 8, 12, 16,and 20 s. The maps show clear correlations with major geological structures and qualitative agreement with previous results based on Rayleigh wave group speeds.},

	abstract = {Ambient noise correlation method has been widely used to extract surface waves and tomography. The extraction of body waves has been very limited, but recent reports have suggested promises for deep incident waves. Here we report our first observations of triplicated {PKP} phases (important phases for studying the Earth's core) and confirm observations of other body-wave core phases from noise correlations. We use dense seismic arrays in South America and China Regional Seismic Networks at distances from 145° to the antipode. We can clearly observe different {PKP} branches (df, bc and ab) in stacks of the station–station correlations. Both ambient noise and earthquake coda contribute to {PKP} phases. However, the contributions vary with frequency and with body-wave phases. At shorter periods (5–20 s), three branches of {PKP} (df, bc and ab) can be extracted from ambient noise and the ab phase from earthquake coda. At longer periods (15–50 s), earthquake coda are effective in generating the df branch, but not the ab branch. The generation of the {PKIKP} phase (df branch) from earthquake coda does not depend on earthquake focal mechanisms or focal depths. However, earthquakes far from the stations contribute more than events closer by. The best coda window is around 10 000–40 000 s and the best magnitude threshold is Mw greater than 6.8 or 6.9. The observation of triplicated {PKP} branches from noise correlations provides a new type of data for studying the Earth's deep interior, in particularly the inner core anisotropy, which overcomes some of the limitations of traditional earthquake-based studies (such as limited source distributions and source location errors).},

	abstract = {The seismic correlation wavefield constructed from stacked cross-correlograms of event signals displays a wide range of features as a function of inter-station distance. The character of such correlation arrivals changes markedly with the segment of the wavefield employed. All such correlation arrivals arise from the interaction of seismic phases that have a common slowness at the pair of stations being correlated. It takes some time before a clear correlation field is established, but after 1 h from event initiation a weak version of the regular wavefield emerges accompanied by many phases that have no counterpart in the direct source excitation. Such arrivals are produced by the interaction of seismic phases with common propagation legs, and have time-distance behaviour controlled by the differences in accumulated phase. The regular phases fade with time and then distinct arrivals in the correlation field arise when there are many ways in which combinations of seismic phases have the same difference in propagation legs. There are many more such possibilities for steeply travelling waves in the late coda, so that a relatively stable correlation field develops. The properties of the correlation field as a function of time can be well described by using a representation in terms of generalized rays supplemented by the contribution from the fundamental mode Rayleigh wave.},

	abstract = {The 75 year history of the American Geophysical Union has accompanied great advances in our understanding of the physics and chemistry of the transition zone between the Earth's core and mantle. The core-mantle boundary ({CMB}) is the most significant internal boundary within our planet, buried at remote depths and probably forever hidden from direct observation; yet this region is very important to our understanding of the dynamic Earth system. The thermal and chemical processes operating near the {CMB} have intimate relationships to fundamental events in Earth history, such as core formation, and continue to play a major role in the planet's evolution, influencing the magnetic field behavior, chemical cycling in the mantle, irregularities in the rotation and gravitation of the planet, and the mode of thermal convection of the Earth. The D'' region, comprising the lowermost 300 km of the mantle, is known to be highly heterogeneous in material properties on large and small scales, presumably due to thermal and chemical variations, while the outermost core is much more uniform. The substantial knowledge that we now have about this remote region is testimony to the remarkable progress made in geophysical remote sensing, prompted by prodigious increases in data, computational power, and experimental methodologies used to investigate deep earth structure and processes. In the past decade in particular there have been unprecedented multidisciplinary advances in understanding the {CMB} region, and there are excellent prospects for developing a comprehensive understanding of this region in the next few decades. Fundamental issues yet to be resolved include the causes of layering extensively observed in D'', whether or not downwelling slabs accumulate at the base of the mantle, whether plumes arise from the {CMB} region to feed hotspots at Earth's surface, the extent of core-mantle chemical reactions, the relative importance of topographic versus electromagnetic coupling across the {CMB}, and the degree to which mantle structure influences the geomagnetic field and its reversals. This overview highlights the progress and future directions in geophysical investigations of the {CMB} region.},

	abstract = {We invert the Martian tidal response and mean mass and moment of inertia for chemical composition, thermal state, and interior structure. The inversion combines phase equilibrium computations with a laboratory-based viscoelastic dissipation model. The rheological model, which is based on measurements of anhydrous and melt-free olivine, is both temperature and grain size sensitive and imposes strong constraints on interior structure. The bottom of the lithosphere, defined as the location where the conductive geotherm meets the mantle adiabat, occurs deep within the upper mantle (∼200–400 km depth) resulting in apparent upper mantle low-velocity zones. Assuming an Fe-{FeS} core, our results indicate (1) a mantle with a Mg\# (molar Mg/Mg+Fe) of ∼0.75 in agreement with earlier geochemical estimates based on analysis of Martian meteorites; (2) absence of bridgmanite- and ferropericlase-dominated basal layer; (3) core compositions (15–18.5 wt\% S), core radii (1,730–1,840 km), and core-mantle boundary temperatures (1620–1690°C) that, together with the eutectic-like core compositions, suggest that the core is liquid; and (4) bulk Martian compositions with a Fe/Si (weight ratio) of 1.66–1.81. We show that the inversion results can be used in tandem with geodynamic simulations to identify plausible geodynamic scenarios and parameters. Specifically, we find that the inversion results are largely reproducible by stagnant lid convection models for a range of initial viscosities (∼1018–1020 Pa s) and radioactive element partitioning between crust and mantle around 0.01–0.1. The geodynamic models predict a mean surface heat flow between 15 and 25 {mW}/m2.},

The faults were mapped on the basis of Mars Orbiting Laser Altimeter ({MOLA}) shaded relief. Hence we expect to have assembled a homogeneous data set, not biased by illumination and viewing conditions of image data. Updated models of Martian crater statistics and geological maps were used to assign new maximum ages to all faults. On the basis of the fault catalog, spatial distributions of seismicity were simulated, using assumptions on the available annual seismic moment budget, the moment-frequency relationship, and a relation between rupture length and released moment. We have constructed five different models of Martian seismicity, predicting an annual moment release between 3.42 × 1016 Nm and 4.78 × 1018 Nm and up to 572 events with magnitudes greater than 4 per year as upper limit end-member case.

An improved understanding of the location, magnitude, and frequency of potential seismic sources is essential for optimization of instrument design, sampling strategy, and interpretation of mission data. We focus on forecasting seismic activity for the Cerberus Fossae of the Elysium Planitia, chosen for their proximity to the proposed landing site and their recent formation and assuming these are active tectonic grabens. The minimum age we determine for the units around the Fossae, using Context Camera and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment imagery for crater density surveying, is 10 Ma, placing them in the Late Amazonian. We are able to determine the rate of motion from measurements of observed throw, assuming that the faults remain active. Digital terrain models, made from stereo-image pairs from the High Resolution Stereo Camera ({HRSC}), are used to determine the maximum throw on four graben systems. Using these measured throws to estimate a length-averaged slip and assuming an inferred slip rate from surface age, we estimate an annual moment release of . From this we calculate an annual size-frequency distribution of events using the Gütenberg-Richter relationship. We estimate that between 1.5×100and 1.9×105events per year will have an amplitude greater than the peak band noise and so will be detectable at the {InSight} landing site.},

	abstract = {The density profile of an {SNC} model Martian interior is calculated from the results of previous experimental work that determined the modal mineralogy of the model mantle up to Martian core-mantle boundary pressures. The moment-of-inertia factor of Mars is calculated as a function of core composition and crustal thickness using the {SNC} model mantle density profile as a constraint. Two sets of calculations are performed. In the first, the bulk composition of the planet is not constrained to a C1 chondrite composition. Assuming a Martian crust density of 2.7–3.0 g/cm3, a crust thickness of 25–150 km, and the core composition proposed by Dreibus and Wänke, Fe 14 wt\% S, the calculated moment-of-inertia factor ranges from 0.367 to 0.357. These models include a perovskite-bearing zone in the Martian interior. Considering core compositions ranging from pure Fe to pure {FeS} changes the moment-of-inertia factor by only ±0.001, but at higher S abundances, core size increases, such that the depth of the core-mantle boundary is shallower than the depth of perovskite stability. In the second set of calculations, the bulk composition of the planet is constrained to a C1 composition requiring a crust thickness of 180–320 km, assuming a crust density of 2.7–3.0 g/cm3. The calculated moment-of-inertia factor is 0.354 and a perovskite-bearing layer is absent from the Martian interior. As it is unlikely that the thickness of the Martian crust is greater than 100 km, the bulk composition of Mars cannot be constrained to a C1 chondrite composition as proposed by the Dreibus and Wänke model (G. Dreibus, H. Wänke, Meteoritics 20 (1985) 367–382). In order to determine if the Martian mantle is more iron-rich than the Earth's mantle, we may need not only an improved estimate of the moment-of-inertia factor of Mars, but also tighter constraints on Martian crust thickness and density. The absolute degree of iron-enrichment, however, cannot be specified without also knowing the size of the Martian core. A moment-of-inertia factor of less than 0.342 is not geochemically feasible, because it requires that the mantle of Mars contains no iron.},

	abstract = {The Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter ({MOLA}), an instrument on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, has measured the topography, surface roughness, and 1.064-μm reflectivity of Mars and the heights of volatile and dust clouds. This paper discusses the function of the {MOLA} instrument and the acquisition, processing, and correction of observations to produce global data sets. The altimeter measurements have been converted to both gridded and spherical harmonic models for the topography and shape of Mars that have vertical and radial accuracies of ∼1 m with respect to the planet's center of mass. The current global topographic grid has a resolution of 1/64° in latitude × 1/32° in longitude (1×2 km2 at the equator). Reconstruction of the locations of incident laser pulses on the Martian surface appears to be at the 100-m spatial accuracy level and results in 2 orders of magnitude improvement in the global geodetic grid of Mars. Global maps of optical pulse width indicative of 100-m-scale surface roughness and 1.064-μm reflectivity with an accuracy of 5\% have also been obtained.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on physical parameters (flow rates and rheological properties) of lava flows observed in the Central Elysium Planitia ({CEP}) region of Mars. The flows are modeled as Newtonian fluids, using the Jeffrey's equation and the concept of Graetz number, or alternatively as Bingham fluids. In addition to these approaches, a theoretical model of the shape of shield volcanoes based on the solution for the porous flow of an unconfined aquifer is applied to 5 shields, providing independent quantifications of rheological variations between the shields. This analysis indicates that of the five volcanoes studied, two are partially buried by lava postdating their formation, a result which has been confirmed independently in one case by high resolution images. Our observations reveal that two types of lava flows may be found in the {CEP} region. The first group is composed of large lava flows with viscosities around ∼2.5×105 Pa s or yield strengths ranging from 100 to 500 Pa. The second group includes small lava flows of the shield volcanoes and large leveed lava channels on the plains with viscosities below 103 Pa s, or yield strengths less than 200 Pa. When compared with other volcanic regions on Mars investigated with similar approaches, these latter values are, at present, the lowest inferred for martian lava flows. Several hypotheses for the formation of these lavas are discussed in the context of {CEP} given that low viscosity can be the result of (1) high temperature, (2) low crystal content, (3) low Si abundance of the liquid phase, and/or (4) the presence of dissolved volatiles. Two scenarios are considered. In the first one, it is demonstrated that low viscosity lavas (of low silica content) can be produced in the context proposed by Schumacher and Breuer [Schumacher, S., Breuer, D., 2007. Geophys. Res. Lett. 34. L12202] for recent volcanism. However, geochemical maps derived from {GRS} measurements do not provide support for anomalously low silica concentrations in this region. In the second scenario, a water-rich magma is proposed, although arguments in favor of a water-rich mantle source below the {CEP} are not available at the present time.},

	abstract = {The Bulletin of the International Seismological Centre ({ISC}) remains in demand for a wide range of geophysical studies. Users of the {ISC} Bulletin benefit from its long-term coverage, the most comprehensive set of measurements from the majority of permanent seismic stations and networks, and homogeneity of included parameters of earthquakes and other seismic events worldwide. Despite a reasonably conservative approach in preserving the operational procedures, changes are inevitable in order to achieve the best possible accuracy of published earthquake parameters. The last fundamental change in procedures has fully affected the data for years 2011 and beyond (Bondár and Storchak in Geophys J Int 186: 1220-1244, 2011). This is why it was decided to rebuild the earlier part (1964–2010) of the {ISC} Bulletin to achieve compatibility in earthquake hypocentres and magnitudes through its entire period. The first article on this project (Storchak et al. in Geosci Lett 4: 32, 2017) covered the period from 1964 to 1979, as it was publicly released. This article covers the remaining period from 1980 to 2010 with all seismic events re-processed and re-located in line with the modern {ISC} procedures, with {\textasciitilde} 489,000 new events, {\textasciitilde} 2600 new stations, {\textasciitilde}15.5 million new seismic arrivals, and more robust and reliable mb and {MS} magnitude evaluations. We give statistics of departures in epicentre location and depth between the original and rebuilt {ISC} hypocentres. We also provide a summary for the entire rebuilt period (1964–2010). We give a brief account of events deleted from and added to the Bulletin, based on additional reports from permanent and temporary seismic deployments. We explain that newly re-computed (rebuilt) mb is on average larger that the original mb by 0.05 unit of magnitude. The rebuilt {MS} is only 0.01 unit larger that its predecessor. We announce that the entire reviewed part of the {ISC} Bulletin (1964–2017) is now based on the same velocity model, ak135, and the same earthquake location and magnitude computation procedures. Finally, we provide advice on how to obtain the original {ISC} Bulletin data, where necessary.},

Tectonic activity peaked in the Noachian (stage 1) around the largest center, Claritas, an elongate center extending more than 20° in latitude and defined by about half of the total grabens which are concentrated in the Syria Planum, Thaumasia, and Tempe Terra regions. During the Late Noachian and Early Hesperian (stage 2), extensional structures formed along the length of present-day Valles Marineris and in Thaumasia (with a secondary concentration near Warrego Vallis) radial to a region just to the south of the central margin of Valles Marineris. Early Hesperian (stage 3) radial grabens in Pavonis, Syria, Ulysses, and Tempe Terra and somewhat concentric wrinkle ridges in Lunae and Solis Plana and in Thaumasia, Sirenum, Memnonia, and Amazonis are centered northwest of Syria with secondary centers at Thaumasia, Tempe Terra, Ulysses Fossae, and western Valles Marineris. Late Hesperian/Early Amazonian (stage 4) structures around Alba Patera, the northeast trending alignment of Tharsis Montes, and Olympus Mons appears centered on Alba Patera. Stage 5 structures (Middle-Late Amazonian) represent the last pulse of Tharsis-related activity and are found around the large shield volcanoes and are centered near Pavonis Mons. Tectonic activity around Tharsis began in the Noachian and generally decreased through geologic time to the Amazonian. Statistically significant radial distributions of structures formed during each stage, centered at different locations within the higher elevations of Tharsis. Secondary centers of radial structures during many of the stages appear related to previously identified local magmatic centers that formed at different times and locations throughout Tharsis.},

	abstract = {Since February 2019, {NASA}'s {InSight} lander is recording seismic signals on the planet Mars, which, for the first time, allows to observe ongoing tectonic processes with geophysical methods. A number of Marsquakes have been located in the Cerberus Fossae graben system in Elysium Planitia and further west, in the Orcus Patera depression. We present a first study of the focal mechanisms of three well-recorded events (S0173a, S0183a, S0235b) to determine the processes dominating in the source region. We infer for all three events a predominantly extensional setting. Our method is adapted to the case of a single, multicomponent receiver and based on fitting waveforms of P and S waves against synthetic seismograms computed for the initial crustal velocity model derived by the {InSight} team. We explore the uncertainty due to the single-station limitation and find that even data recorded by one station constrains the mechanisms (reasonably) well. For the events in the Cerberus Fossae region (S0173a, S0235b) normal faulting with a relatively steep dipping fault plane is inferred, suggesting an extensional regime mainly oriented E-W to {NE}-{SW}. The fault regime in the Orcus Patera region is not determined uniquely because only the P wave can be used for the source inversion. However, we find that the P and weak S waves of the S0183a event show similar polarities to the event S0173, which indicates similar fault regimes.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of large-scale mantle dynamics depends on accurate models of seismic velocity variation in the upper mantle transition zone (400–1000 km depth). With the Mode Branch Stripping technique ({MBS}) of van Heijst and Woodhouse [1997] it is possible to extract the dispersion characteristics of overtone surface wave signals from single source-receiver overtone waveforms. Such data provide new global transition zone constraints. We combined more than a million measurements of path-average overtone phase velocity with normal-mode splitting functions and body wave travel times to construct model S20RTSb of shear velocity heterogeneity throughout the mantle. We discuss in detail the resolution of structural heterogeneity in the transition zone. The main observations are the following: (1) Large-scale shear velocity variations (15\%) in the upper 250 km of the mantle are at least 5 times larger than deeper in the mantle. High-velocity keels of Archean cratons extend to about 200 km depth. Low velocities related to mid-ocean ridge upwelling are confined to the upper 150 km of the mantle. (2) The 220-km discontinuity in {PREM} cannot be reconciled with Rayleigh wave dispersion, especially in oceans. (3) The velocity below the oceanic lithosphere (350–400 km depth) is 1–1.5\% lower than beneath the continental lithosphere. (4) High-velocity slabs of former oceanic lithosphere are conspicuous structures just above the 670-km discontinuity. They extend to about 1100 km depth in the South American, Indonesian, and Kermadec subduction zones, indicating that slabs penetrate through the 670-km phase transition in several subduction zones. (5) We observe lower-than-average shear velocity below the lithosphere at eight hot spots (including Hawaii, Iceland, Easter, and Afar). It is, however, difficult to accurately estimate their depth extent in the transition zone because of the limited vertical resolution.},

Although radial anisotropy has been found to extend deeper beneath continents than beneath oceans, we find no such difference for azimuthal anisotropy, suggesting that beneath most continents, the alignment of olivine crystal is preferentially horizontal and azimuthally random at large scale. As most continents are located on slow moving plates, this supports the idea that azimuthal anisotropy aligns at large scale with the present plate motion only for plates faster than ∼4 cm yr−1.},

	shorttitle = {Origin of coda waves},
	abstract = {Coda waves from small local earthquakes are interpreted as backscattering waves from numerous heterogeneities distributed uniformly in the earth's crust. Two extreme models of the wave medium that account for the observations on the coda are proposed. In the single backscattering model the scattering is considered to be a weak process, and the loss of seismic energy by scattering is neglected. In the diffusion model the seismic energy transfer is considered as a diffusion process. Both models lead to similar formulas that allow an accurate separation of the effect of earthquake source from the effects of scattering and attenuation on the coda spectra. A unique difference was found in the scaling law of earthquake source spectra between central California and western Japan, which may be attributed to the difference in inhomogeneity length of the earth's crust. The Q of coda waves in the two regions is strongly frequency dependent with values increasing from 50–200 at 1 Hz to about 1000–2000 at 20 Hz. This observation is interpreted as a combined effect of variation of Q with depth and frequency-dependent composition of coda waves described below. The turbidity coefficient of the lithosphere required at 1 Hz to explain the observed coda as body wave scattering is orders of magnitude greater than previously known values such as those obtained by Aki (1973) and Capon (1974) under the Montana Lasa from the amplitude and phase fluctuations of teleseismic P waves. From the high attenuation and turbidity obtained at this frequency we conclude that at around 1 Hz the coda is made of backscattering surface waves from heterogeneities in the shallow, low-Q lithosphere. The high Q observed for the coda at frequencies higher than 10 Hz, on the other hand, eliminates the possibility that these waves are backscattering surface waves. We conclude that at these high frequencies the coda must be made of backscattering body waves from heterogeneities in the deep lithosphere. The low turbidities found for deep earthquake sources under western Japan are consistent with this model of coda wave generation.},

Destructive interference among adjacent frequencies in the broad-band pulse renders a cross-correlation traveltime measurement sensitive only to the wave speed in a hollow banana-shaped region surrounding the unperturbed geometrical ray. The Fréchet kernel expressing this sensitivity is expressed as a double sum over all forward-propagating body waves from the source and backward-propagating body waves from the receiver to every single scatterer in the vicinity of this central ray. The kernel for a differential traveltime, measured by cross-correlation of two phases at the same receiver, is simply the difference of the respective single-phase kernels. In the paraxial approximation, an absolute or differential traveltime kernel can be computed extremely economically by implementing a single kinematic and dynamic ray trace along each source-to-receiver ray.},

The predictions of the theory are in excellent agreement with ‘ground truth’traveltime shifts, measured by cross-correlation of heterogeneous-medium and homogeneous-medium synthetic seismograms, computed using a parallelized pseudospectral code. Scattering, wave-front healing and other finite-requency diffraction effects can give rise to cross-correlation traveltime shifts that are in significant disagreement with geometrical ray theory, whenever the cross-ath width of wave-peed heterogeneity is of the same order as the width of the banana—doughnut Fréchet kernel surrounding the ray. A concentrated off-ath slow or fast anomaly can give rise to a larger traveltime shift than one directly on the ray path, by virtue of the hollow-banana character of the kernel. The often intricate 3-D geometry of the sensitivity kernels of P, {PP}, {PcP}, {PcP}2, {PcP}3, … and P+{pPwaves} is explored, in a series of colourful cross-sections. The geometries of an absolute {PPkernel} and a differential {PP}— Pkernel are particularly complicated, because of the minimax nature of the surface-reflected {PPwave}. The kernel for an overlapping P+{pPwave} from a shallow-focus source has a banana–doughnut character, like that of an isolated P-wave kernel, even when the teleseismic pulse shape is significantly distorted by the depth phase interference. A numerically economical representation of the 3-D traveltime sensitivity, based upon the paraxial approximation, is in excellent agreement with the ‘exact’ ray-theoretical Fréchet kernel.},

	abstract = {We examine the nature of seismic heterogeneity in the continental lithosphere, with particular reference to Australia. With the inclusion of deterministic large-scale structure and realistic medium-scale features, there is not a need for strong fine-scale variations. The resulting multiscale heterogeneity model gives a good representation of the character of observed seismograms and their geographic variation, and is also in good agreement with recent direct results on P wave reflectivity in the lithosphere. Fine-scale heterogeneity is pervasive, but strongest in the crust. There is a weak quasi-laminar component above the lithosphere-asthenosphere transition with horizontal correlation length of 10 km and vertical correlation length of 0.5 km. Within the transition, the aspect ratio of heterogeneity changes and can be well represented with a horizontal correlation length of 5 km and vertical correlation length of 1 km. For the Australian cratons, this transition zone needs low intrinsic attenuation (high Q) to sustain the long high-frequency coda of both P and S waves. The interaction of the different aspects of the heterogeneity is complex and produces a diversity of behavior depending on the relative thickness of the different lithospheric zones. The multiscale model reconciles many of the divergent concepts of the character of heterogeneity based on interpretations of particular aspects of the seismic wavefield. The varying nature of the heterogeneity also ties well with the variations in tectonic character across the Australian continent.},

The geometry of a teleseismic S wave kernel is, at first sight, extremely paradoxical: the sensitivity is zero everywhere along the geometrical ray! The shape of the kernel resembles that of a hollow banana; in a cross-section perpendicular to the ray, the shape resembles a doughnut. The cross-path extent of such a banana–doughnut kernel depends upon the frequency content of the wave. The kernel for a very high-frequency wave is a very skinny hollow banana; wave-speed heterogeneity wider than this banana affects the traveltime, in accordance with ray theory. We also use the Born approximation to compute the sensitivity kernel {KΔT}(r) of a differential traveltime ΔT measured by cross-correlation of two phases, such as {SS} and S, at the same receiver. The geometries of both an absolute {SS} wave kernel and a differential {SS}–S kernel are extremely complicated, particularly in the vicinity of the surface reflection point and the source-to-receiver and receiver-to-source caustics, because of the minimax character of the {SS} wave.

High lateral resolution is achieved, but structure is averaged over depth. As such, this method is complementary to surface-wave and tomographic body-wave methods, where averaging takes place in the lateral sense. Processing and data-volume requirements involved are minimal. Therefore, this method can be applied during the early stages of array deployment, before the necessary data is acquired to obtain accurate inversion images.

We show that for an arbitrary small scatterer, the cross terms of scattered waves give an unphysical wave with an arrival time that is independent of the source position. This constitutes an apparent inconsistency because theory predicts that such spurious arrivals do not arise, after integration over a complete source aperture. This puzzling inconsistency can be resolved for an arbitrary scatterer by integrating the contribution of all sources in the stationary phase approximation to show that the stationary phase contributions to the source integral cancel the spurious arrival by virtue of the generalized optical theorem. This work constitutes an alternative derivation of this theorem. When the source aperture is incomplete, the spurious arrival is not canceled and could be misinterpreted to be part of the Green’s function. We give an example of how spurious arrivals provide information about the medium complementary to that given by the direct and scattered waves; the spurious waves can thus potentially be used to better constrain the medium.},

The method is based upon a weak formulation of the equations of motion and combines the flexibility of a finite-element method with the accuracy of a global pseudospectral method. The finite-element mesh honours all first- and second-order discontinuities in the earth model. To maintain a relatively constant resolution throughout the model in terms of the number of grid points per wavelength, the size of the elements is increased with depth in a conforming fashion, thus retaining a diagonal mass matrix. In the Earth's mantle and inner core we solve the wave equation in terms of displacement, whereas in the liquid outer core we use a formulation based upon a scalar potential. The three domains are matched at the inner core and core–mantle boundaries, honouring the continuity of traction and the normal component of velocity. The effects of attenuation and anisotropy are fully incorporated. The method is implemented on a parallel computer using a message passing technique. We benchmark spectral-element synthetic seismograms against normal-mode synthetics for a spherically symmetric reference model. The two methods are in excellent agreement for all body- and surface-wave arrivals with periods greater than about 20 s.},

For spatially localized changes in the velocity, or for changes in the source location, the travel-time perturbation may be different for different scattering paths. The coda waves that arrive within a certain time window are therefore subject to a distribution of travel-time perturbations. Here I present the general theory of coda wave interferometry, and show how the time-shifted correlation coefficient can be used to estimate the mean and variance of the distribution of travel-time perturbations. I show how this general theory can be used to estimate changes in the wave velocity, in the location of scatterer positions, and in the source location.},

This concept is called seismic interferometry. Of all these noise sources, those for whom the travel time difference for propagation to the two receivers is in the stationary phase zone, give the dominant contribution. In this paper we analyze the stationary phase properties when one receiver is at a caustic for waves leaving the other receiver. A simple model for a waveguide and a general treatment of caustics show that, at a caustic, the curvature of the travel time difference at the stationary phase zone vanishes. As a result the stationary phase region is considerably wider at a caustic than at other points, and it is more likely that noise sources are present in the stationary phase region. This explains why it is easier to extract waves from seismic interferometry when the receivers are at caustics such as antipodal receivers on the Earth.},

	shorttitle = {Tutorial on seismic interferometry},
	abstract = {In the 1990s, the method of time-reversed acoustics was developed. This method exploits the fact that the acoustic wave equation for a lossless medium is invariant for time reversal. When ultrasonic responses recorded by piezoelectric transducers are reversed in time and fed simultaneously as source signals to the transducers, they focus at the position of the original source, even when the medium is very complex. In seismic interferometry the time-reversed responses are not physically sent into the earth, but they are convolved with other measured responses. The effect is essentially the same: The time-reversed signals focus and create a virtual source which radiates waves into the medium that are subsequently recorded by receivers. A mathematical derivation, based on reciprocity theory, formalizes this principle: The crosscorrelation of responses at two receivers, integrated over differ-ent sources, gives the Green’s function emitted by a virtual source at the position of one of the receivers and observed by the other receiver. This Green’s function representation for seismic interferometry is based on the assumption that the medium is lossless and nonmoving. Recent developments, circumventing these assumptions, include interferometric representations for attenuating and/or moving media, as well as unified representations for waves and diffusion phenomena, bending waves, quantum mechanical scattering, potential fields, elastodynamic, electromagnetic, poroelastic, and electroseismic waves. Significant improvements in the quality of the retrieved Green’s functions have been obtained with interferometry by deconvolution. A trace-by-trace deconvolution process compensates for complex source functions and the attenuation of the medium. Interferometry by multidimensional deconvolution also compensates for the effects of one-sided and/or irregular illumination.},

While such previously known liquid immiscibility has been demonstrated to disappear at relatively low pressures, here we report immiscible S(±Si,O)-rich liquid and H(±C)-rich liquid above {\textasciitilde}20 {GPa}, corresponding to conditions of the Martian core. Mars’ cosmochemically estimated core composition is likely in the miscibility gap, and the separation of two immiscible liquids could have driven core convection and stable stratification, which explains the formation and termination of the Martian planetary magnetic field. In addition, we observed liquid immiscibility in Fe-S-H(±Si,O,C) at least to 118 {GPa}, suggesting that it can occur in the Earth’s topmost outer core and form a low-velocity layer below the core-mantle boundary.},

Based on nine marsquake templates, we report 47 newly detected events, {\textgreater}90\% of which are associated with the two high-quality events located beneath Cerberus Fossae. They occurred at all times of the Martian day, thus excluding the tidal modulation (e.g., Phobos) as their cause. We attribute the newly discovered, low-frequency, repetitive events to magma movement associated with volcanic activity in the upper mantle beneath Cerberus Fossae. The continuous seismicity suggests that Cerberus Fossae is seismically highly active and that the Martian mantle is mobile.},

Our results indicate that if the proto-Earth and the Moon-forming impactor Theia grew by pebble accretion, core-forming metals in each body segregated from mantle-forming silicates within the first few million years of solar system history, while both were enveloped in atmospheres composed of nebular gas. Thermal blanketing by their energy-absorbing atmospheres, heat produced by radioactive decay of aluminum-26, and gravitational energy released by metal segregation resulted in very high internal temperatures, such that the mantle and core of both bodies experienced partial or total melting during accretion. We calculate pressure-temperature conditions where the core-forming metals are predicted to have segregated from magma ocean silicates under pebble accretion. Two-body combinations of these conditions, representing the merger of proto-Earth and Theia, yield average segregation pressures and temperatures that are similar to core segregation conditions previously inferred for impact-driven Earth accretion constrained by metal-silicate partitioning of siderophile elements.},

Many of these planetesimals had metallic iron cores and during growth of the Earth this metal re-equilibrated with the Earth's silicate mantle, extracting siderophile (‘iron-loving’) elements into the Earth's iron-rich core. The current composition of the mantle indicates that much of the re-equilibration took place in a deep ({\textgreater} 400 km) molten silicate layer, or ‘magma ocean’, and that conditions became more oxidizing with time as the Earth grew. The high-pressure nature of the core-forming process led to the Earth's core being richer in low-atomic-number elements, notably silicon and possibly oxygen, than the cores of the smaller planetesimal building blocks.},

	abstract = {{NASA}’s {InSight} (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) mission has operated a sophisticated suite of seismology and geophysics instruments on the surface of Mars since its arrival in 2018. On 18 February 2021, we attempted to detect the seismic and acoustic waves produced by the entry, descent and landing of the Perseverance rover using the sensors onboard the {InSight} lander. Similar observations have been made on Earth using data from both crewed1,2 and uncrewed3,4 spacecraft, and on the Moon during the Apollo era5, but never before on Mars or another planet. This was the only seismic event to occur on Mars since {InSight} began operations that had an a priori known and independently constrained timing and location. It therefore had the potential to be used as a calibration for other marsquakes recorded by {InSight}. Here we report that no signal from Perseverance’s entry, descent and landing is identifiable in the {InSight} data. Nonetheless, measurements made during the landing window enable us to place constraints on the distance–amplitude relationships used to predict the amplitude of seismic waves produced by planetary impacts and place in situ constraints on Martian impact seismic efficiency (the fraction of the impactor kinetic energy converted into seismic energy).},

	abstract = {The Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure ({SEIS}) of the {InSight} mission to Mars has been providing direct information on Martian interior structure and dynamics of that planet since it landed. Compared with seismic recordings on the Earth, ground-motion measurements acquired by {SEIS} on Mars are not only made under dramatically different ambient noise conditions, but also include idiosyncratic signals that arise from coupling between different {InSight} sensors and spacecraft components. This work is to synthesize what is known about these signal types, illustrate how they can manifest in waveforms and noise correlations, and present pitfalls in structural interpretations based on standard seismic analysis methods. We show that glitches (a type of prominent transient signal) can produce artifacts in ambient noise correlations. Sustained signals that vary in frequency, such as lander modes that are affected by variations in temperature and wind conditions over the course of the Martian sol, can also contaminate ambient noise results. Therefore, both types of signals have the potential to bias interpretation in terms of subsurface layering. We illustrate that signal processing in the presence of identified nonseismic signals must be informed by an understanding of the underlying physical processes in order for high-fidelity waveforms of ground motion to be extracted. Whereas the origins of the most idiosyncratic signals are well understood, the 2.4 Hz resonance remains debated, and the literature does not contain an explanation of its fine spectral structure. Even though the selection of idiosyncratic signal types discussed in this article may not be exhaustive, we provide guidance on the best practices for enhancing the robustness of structural interpretations.},

Low-frequency Rayleigh waves (0.25–1 Hz) show diurnal variations and a dominant back azimuth related to the wind direction in a nearby area. Low-frequency signals that are derived mainly from wind may be sensitive to subsurface structure deeper than the lithological boundary derived from an autocorrelation analysis. On the other hand, dominant back azimuths of high-frequency ({\textgreater}1 Hz) waves point toward the {InSight} lander, especially in daytime, indicating that wind-induced lander noise is dominant at high frequencies.

We identify the noise that is approximately periodic with the Martian sol as daily lander operations and the diurnal variation in Martian weather and tides. To investigate the seismic discontinuities at different depths, the autocorrelograms are filtered and stacked into different frequency bands. We observe prominent reflection signals probably corresponding to the Martian Moho, the olivine-wadsleyite transition in the mantle, and the core-mantle boundary in the stacked autocorrelograms. We estimate the depths of these boundaries as 35, 1,110–1,170, and 1,520–1,600 km, consistent with other estimates.},
